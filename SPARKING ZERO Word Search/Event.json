    "SENTENCE_0294": "Uh, okay... That's a pretty creepy thing to say.",
    "SENTENCE_0295": "Whassup! I mean, good day and greetings! So, what's goin' on with you?\r\nWhaddya want?\r\n",
    "SENTENCE_0296": "You know, I don't know what you're rambling on about.",
    "SENTENCE_0297": "Of course you don't. Your mind is too small. Your kind\r\nis incapable of understanding the grandeur of my\r\nsuccess and the glory of my cause.",

    "SENTENCE_0303": "This scythe will carve a reminder into your mortal\r\nflesh of the strength of my divine wrath!",
    "SENTENCE_0304": "Hahahaha! Just as we foresaw! Fighting this formidable\r\nSaiyan blight has carried us both to new heights!",
    "SENTENCE_0305": "This proves our transformative power! Our destiny is to\r\ncast judgement upon all creation!",
    "SENTENCE_0306": "Very well. No more games or half-measures.",
    "SENTENCE_0307": "Because these insolent mortals continue to defy and\r\nprofane us, we will reveal\r\nto them the ultimate power of the gods!",

    "SENTENCE_0309": "You pathetic, lowly mortals...",
    "SENTENCE_0310": "Kneel before our radiance!",
    "SENTENCE_0311": "Show your reverence, and bow down before our splendor!",
    "SENTENCE_0312": "You scum! I'll crush you... crush you all! How dare you\r\ndefy the mightiest god in all of history!",
    "SENTENCE_0313": "Good. That's enough for today, boys. Won't get anywhere\r\nif you push yourselves too hard.",
    "SENTENCE_0314": "Blasphemous creature! Despite all my decrees, you're\r\nstill completely oblivious to your sacrilege against me!",
    "SENTENCE_0315": "Your arrogance has spelled the end of your Earth! Don't you see?!",
    "SENTENCE_0316": "I commend you for your fortitude, sinful as it is. You\r\nrefuse to accept your destruction, but in the end... it\r\nwill make no difference.",
    "SENTENCE_0317": "But I only need one more day. Then I'm coming back, and\r\nI promise you... I'll take you down then!",
    "SENTENCE_0318": "They're way stronger than we thought... Three years' training wasn't enough.\r\nSo, the only way we're gonna stand a chance now...is to train some more.",
    "SENTENCE_0319": "Just get to it already! We'll start with some freestyle.",
    "SENTENCE_0320": "That's correct! It's the leader of the Ginyu Force. The\r\none, the only, Captain Ginyu!",
    "SENTENCE_0321": "It's time to show them divine perfection made whole!",
    "SENTENCE_0322": "Who ARE you, anyway?!",
    "SENTENCE_0323": "How dare you strike a god and retaliate against justice!",
    "SENTENCE_0324": "Get out of here, villain!",
    "SENTENCE_0325": "Even though I've become stronger from merging with\r\nKami, you fought extremely well against me.",
    "SENTENCE_0326": "So, who will be going up against me first? Will it be\r\nGoku? Oooh, or perhaps Vegeta!",
    "SENTENCE_0327": "Interesting. Your improvements are actually quite\r\nremarkable. Unfortunately, they're still not enough to\r\nsurpass mine.",
    "SENTENCE_0328": "Hahahahaha! Revel in that delusion while you can still\r\ncling to it!",
    "SENTENCE_0329": "Well if you do act up, I'll just put you down again.",
    "SENTENCE_0330": "Dyaahaahaah! Enough already! Get away from me!",
    "SENTENCE_0331": "Sorry for the long wait!",
    "SENTENCE_0332": "Ngh... You've gotten amazingly powerful while I've been\r\ngone! In fact, I don't think I've been this excited for\r\na fight in who knows how long!",
    "SENTENCE_0333": "I'm Vegeta and Kakarot together. Guess that makes me\r\nVegito. And this...",
    "SENTENCE_0334": "Even though I've become stronger from merging with\r\nKami, you fought extremely well against me.",
    "SENTENCE_0335": "No! Chiaotzu!",
    "SENTENCE_0336": "So...that's it... If Cell blocked that...then...\r\nnone of our attacks are gonna work.",
    "SENTENCE_0337": "Basically, unlike regular Dragon Balls, the Super\r\nDragon Balls have no restrictions on what kind of wish\r\nyou can make.",

    "SENTENCE_0341": "You're nothing but scum! I've had enough of you!",

    "SENTENCE_0343": "Hey, what's the matter? I can't be harder to destroy\r\nthan a planet, right?",
    "SENTENCE_0344": "You haven't figured it out yet?",
    "SENTENCE_0345": "I am the warrior you've heard of in legends. Pure of\r\nheart, and awakened by fury. That's what I am.",
    "SENTENCE_0346": "Let me see what you've got.",
    "SENTENCE_0347": "You're gonna pay for that!",
    "SENTENCE_0348": "Man they're hard to read...",
    "SENTENCE_0349": "You got me! I give up!",

    "SENTENCE_0363": "What is this? Some sort of Super Saiyan bargain sale?",
    "SENTENCE_0364": "Hang in there... You are number one!",

    "SENTENCE_0374": "You're just a snivelling coward!",
    "SENTENCE_0375": "How did you like me now?!",

    "SENTENCE_0583": "Ha! How much longer will you survive?!",
    "SENTENCE_0584": "Right. Let's get to it!",
    "SENTENCE_0585": "Foolish!",
    "SENTENCE_0586": "For the pride of my clan!",

    "SENTENCE_0708": "Time to lay down the law!",
    "SENTENCE_0709": "Let me help you keep that ego of yours in check!",
    "SENTENCE_0710": "It looks like we've got a comedian here.",
    "SENTENCE_0711": "Why don't we warm up a little? Hehehehe!",
    "SENTENCE_0712": "Yes! I always knew I was unbeatable!",
    "SENTENCE_0713": "I'm going to crush you!",
    "SENTENCE_0714": "Come at me! I dare you!",
    "SENTENCE_0715": "Quit your babbling!",
    "SENTENCE_0716": "Everyone! Can I have your attention please?",
    "SENTENCE_0717": "That was just a little hello from yours truly! The real\r\nfight begins now!",
    "SENTENCE_0718": "Ga-woooooo!",
    "SENTENCE_0719": "I'll never lose sight of my quarry! Don't even try it!",
    "SENTENCE_0720": "Take 'em down!",
    "SENTENCE_0721": "I'll tear you limb from limb!",
    "SENTENCE_0722": "Hwah-chah!",
    "SENTENCE_0723": "Hah... This is just sad...",
    "SENTENCE_0724": "I guess I should be thankful, so... Thanks.",
    "SENTENCE_0725": "Yeah! I'll show you just how hard I've been working!",
    "SENTENCE_0726": "Uwaaaaaaaaah!",
    "SENTENCE_0727": "So what if he is?",
    "SENTENCE_0728": "You're not getting away!",
    "SENTENCE_0729": "Damn! I can't concentrate!",
    "SENTENCE_0730": "You feeling that, too?",
    "SENTENCE_0731": "Yeah. She's like... a million times stronger all of a sudden!",
    "SENTENCE_0732": "And by that you mean our love, don't you?",
    "SENTENCE_0733": "Haha! You know it!",
    "SENTENCE_0734": "Yeah!",
    "SENTENCE_0735": "Wait! What the... Their power levels are skyrocketing!",
    "SENTENCE_0736": "My eyes! I can't see!",
    "SENTENCE_0737": "All right, ready? Give it everything you've got!",
    "SENTENCE_0738": "M-my body!",
    "SENTENCE_0739": "Ngh... I... can't move... a muscle!",
    "SENTENCE_0740": "How very astute of you...",
    "SENTENCE_0741": "How incredibly irritating not to have seen the writing\r\non the wall!",
    "SENTENCE_0742": "How quaint. I see there was a small grain of truth in\r\nyour assertion after all.",
    "SENTENCE_0743": "Very well, then... I'm only too happy to put your doubts to rest!",
    "SENTENCE_0744": "It's like something out of a nightmare!",
    "SENTENCE_0745": "It's going to be all right. He's still alive!",
    "SENTENCE_0746": "S-someone's coming!",
    "SENTENCE_0747": "Hang on! Don't go!",
    "SENTENCE_0748": "What for? You want something?",
    "SENTENCE_0749": "And to be honest... I don't wanna have to fight you guys.",
    "SENTENCE_0750": "I seriously don't get this stuff.",
    "SENTENCE_0751": "Ugh! We were so close to stopping this freak!",
    "SENTENCE_0752": "Shut up! You don't know a thing about humanity!",
    "SENTENCE_0753": "Humph. Back to this again. Makes no difference to me.",
    "SENTENCE_0754": "Wait, let's not be hasty.",
    "SENTENCE_0755": "I understand... Yes, you do have a point.",
    "SENTENCE_0756": "I'll join in on the fight, too!",
    "SENTENCE_0757": "Keep on yammering! There's no way I'll lose to the\r\nlikes of you!",
    "SENTENCE_0758": "Well, well...",
    "SENTENCE_0759": "All who stand in our way are eliminated.",
    "SENTENCE_0760": "Ah! So this is your move!",
    "SENTENCE_0761": "What the hell is he talking about?!",
    "SENTENCE_0762": "Like I said before, you're going to have to go through me first!",
    "SENTENCE_0763": "Transgressions that are punishable by death!",
    "SENTENCE_0764": "Agh... My body!",
    "SENTENCE_0765": "All who would dare defy me have been vanquished.",
    "SENTENCE_0766": "You see? I do this for the good of the cosmos. For creation!",
    "SENTENCE_0767": "Don't you see? I am everlasting!",
    "SENTENCE_0768": "I don't give a damn about you or your so-called justice!",
    "SENTENCE_0769": "This can't be good...",
    "SENTENCE_0770": "Th-That power he's using... It can't be!",
    "SENTENCE_0771": "Do it! Kill them all!",
    "SENTENCE_0772": "You brat! What on earth is this power?!",
    "SENTENCE_0773": "What's the rush, my little android? Stay a while. Relax...",
    "SENTENCE_0774": "I could just leave you here to die on your own... but\r\nwhere's the fun in that?",
    "SENTENCE_0775": "While you ultimately came up lacking, you and Vegeta\r\nstill managed to increase your power considerably in a\r\nshort period of time. Tell me, how did you do it?",
    "SENTENCE_0776": "Hmm... If you had more time, could you get even stronger?",
    "SENTENCE_0777": "Hope you don't disappoint me this time...",
    "SENTENCE_0778": "What's wrong? What happened to all the smack-talk?",
    "SENTENCE_0779": "Ooh, now this is a surprise! It seems I've been foolish\r\nto overlook you, kid.",
    "SENTENCE_0780": "What malfunction? Why did I not explode?!",
    "SENTENCE_0781": "I-impossible! How did this happen?! To think I would\r\ntake this much damage!",
    "SENTENCE_0782": "Damn it... Damn it...! Damn it all!",
    "SENTENCE_0783": "H-his ki, it's...",
    "SENTENCE_0784": "This can't be...!",
    "SENTENCE_0785": "You're dead!",
    "SENTENCE_0786": "Beautiful speech.",
    "SENTENCE_0787": "Just so you know, I won't be holding back.",
    "SENTENCE_0788": "They're strong, but I can take them.",
    "SENTENCE_0789": "Rrr! Have it your way.",
    "SENTENCE_0790": "I better watch myself.",
    "SENTENCE_0791": "These androids... They show no signs of exhaustion at all.",
    "SENTENCE_0792": "Damn it! Have they got infinite stamina or what?!",
    "SENTENCE_0793": "The virus is getting worse, isn't it?",
    "SENTENCE_0794": "B-but Dad... You're sure I have a power like that within me?",
    "SENTENCE_0795": "O-okay! Understood!",
    "SENTENCE_0796": "Good... Good, you're fighting back a lot more\r\nimpressively than I expected. You're actually making me\r\nquestion if I might want to retreat or not.",
    "SENTENCE_0797": "Damn! I don't know how much longer we can last... Wait! This energy!",
    "SENTENCE_0798": "M-my body feels heavy... And it's so hot I can barely\r\nbreathe! We have to be in here for a whole year?",
    "SENTENCE_0799": "We have all the food and drink we need. It's the\r\nperfect environment to focus on training.",
    "SENTENCE_0800": "So what kinda training are we gonna be doing?",
    "SENTENCE_0801": "(Hm. What should we focus on?)",
    "SENTENCE_0802": "(I'll begin with giving him more experience in physical combat.)",
    "SENTENCE_0803": "(He needs a stable mind in order to control his power.)",
    "SENTENCE_0804": "In this fight, I'm going to come at you with killing\r\nintent. You need to defend\r\nyourself as if you life depends on it.",
    "SENTENCE_0805": "In this fight, I'm gonna push you to your limit. You\r\nneed to keep yourself grounded\r\nand maintain your anger. Now come on.",
    "SENTENCE_0806": "You need to take this seriously or you'll get hurt!",
    "SENTENCE_0807": "N-ngh! Yes, sir!",
    "SENTENCE_0808": "Whoa! Ah... I got a ways to go!",
    "SENTENCE_0809": "Not a bad start. Don't forget how that feels.",
    "SENTENCE_0810": "I-I'll try my best!",
    "SENTENCE_0811": "I am prepared...to be your first opponent.",
    "SENTENCE_0812": "Good. The training I've endured all this time has been\r\nfor the sole purpose of\r\ntaking you down. So let's go!",
    "SENTENCE_0813": "So go on then... Show me everything you can do!",
    "SENTENCE_0814": "Goodness! The surprises just keep on coming!",
    "SENTENCE_0815": "You're... definitely strong! But...",
    "SENTENCE_0816": "Haah...haah... Don't get too relaxed.",
    "SENTENCE_0817": "Oh, okay, I'll start taking this seriously then...",
    "SENTENCE_0818": "Now that's some energy! Fantastic! I do believe my next\r\nopponent has already been decided.",
    "SENTENCE_0819": "We're not done!",
    "SENTENCE_0820": "Actually, we are.",
    "SENTENCE_0821": "What's wrong? Where did all that confidence disappear to?",
    "SENTENCE_0822": "Eyahahaha! Now it's my turn to torture you before I\r\nkill you! Haha!",
    "SENTENCE_0823": "This was all you had? Hahaha! You should've known when\r\nto stay on the bench.",
    "SENTENCE_0824": "Is this...the end?",
    "SENTENCE_0825": "Ka...me...ha...me...",
    "SENTENCE_0826": "Don't underestimate Earth!",
    "SENTENCE_0827": "You've improved quite a bit, but you still haven't\r\nbecome a true fighter. The real\r\ntraining starts now.",
    "SENTENCE_0828": "Hehehe! Don't worry, this'll be over real soon...",
    "SENTENCE_0829": "Hah. Fear not. This'll be over quick.",
    "SENTENCE_0830": "Heh. Can't believe I'm saying this, but at least this\r\ntime, I was glad to have had\r\nyou all by my side.",
    "SENTENCE_0831": "You scum should consider this an honor...\r\nYou will be the first ones to ever lay eyes\r\nupon me in this next state.",
    "SENTENCE_0832": "What do you think, was it worth the wait? Now... if\r\nyou're ready, let's begin Round 2, shall we?",
    "SENTENCE_0833": "That's it! I'm stepping in!",
    "SENTENCE_0834": "Well, if the universe is to be erased, there will be nothing to conquer unless\r\nthis competition is won. However, I have a condition for participating.",
    "SENTENCE_0835": "A condition? Whatever could it be this time?",
    "SENTENCE_0836": "Well, we are in need of as many potential candidates as\r\npossible... I'll allow it. Who did you have in mind?",
    "SENTENCE_0837": "Interesting. Then I look forward to seeing your best of\r\nthe best in action.",
    "SENTENCE_0838": "Hey, what's the holdup? We gonna fight or what?",
    "SENTENCE_0839": "Yes, the time for talking has passed indeed.",
    "SENTENCE_0840": "Here's a little party trick I don't need any assistance to perform...",
    "SENTENCE_0841": "Before I send you both plummeting at once, here's a\r\ntaste of my true form's unrivaled power!",
    "SENTENCE_0842": "You gave yourself some gold plating? What a joke!",
    "SENTENCE_0843": "No, no I wouldn't say. In fact, their fashion sense does nothing but bore me.\r\nI have no need for such tripe in my empire!",
    "SENTENCE_0844": "H-Hey! Now that's just rude!",
    "SENTENCE_0845": "Yeah, have some respect for our unparalleled beauty!",
    "SENTENCE_0846": "Oh, goody. This is just the type of battle I was hoping to avoid.",
    "SENTENCE_0847": "Yes, my lord! Leave it to us!",
    "SENTENCE_0848": "Another piece of garbage disposed of. I wonder how the\r\nrest of the team has been faring.",
    "SENTENCE_0849": "Hold it!",
    "SENTENCE_0850": "Oh what now?",
    "SENTENCE_0851": "Oh, very well. I could play at the petting zoo for a few minutes.",
    "SENTENCE_0852": "Hm, hehehe... Greetings. Hope none of you mind if I\r\njoin the fun.",
    "SENTENCE_0853": "What in the... Am I seeing double?!",
    "SENTENCE_0854": "Surrender now, or I'll be forced to take your life.",
    "SENTENCE_0855": "Hahahaha! I was about to recommend you do the same!",
    "SENTENCE_0856": "Final warning... Run while you still can.",
    "SENTENCE_0857": "I'm so glad you've noticed. I've been training intensively every day \r\nsince my return to make sure I wouldn't lose to you again.",
    "SENTENCE_0858": "Having to put real effort into anything was a first for me, Goku.\r\nI'll make sure you pay for that as well. Hehehe...",
    "SENTENCE_0859": "That's exactly the kind of small-minded drivel that\r\nmakes your existence so intolerable.",
    "SENTENCE_0860": "B-Beerus!",
    "SENTENCE_0861": "Ahahaha! What a glorious sight to behold!",
    "SENTENCE_0862": "Damn you...!",
    "SENTENCE_0863": "You cannot imagine how long I've waited for this.",
    "SENTENCE_0864": "Curse you!",
    "SENTENCE_0865": "I have no objection.",
    "SENTENCE_0866": "Ahahahaha... Then it looks like we have a deal.",
    "SENTENCE_0867": "(Strange... I could swear I've seen him before...)",
    "SENTENCE_0868": "I'll handle this! Whatever happens, you just stay put!\r\nI forbid you to interfere in any way!",
    "SENTENCE_0869": "You meddling brats! I hope you enjoy suffering the same\r\nfate as this planet!",
    "SENTENCE_0870": "Take this, you pathetic insects!",
    "SENTENCE_0871": "Victory!",
    "SENTENCE_0872": "It's what you deserve! For I... am the most powerful\r\nbeing in the universe! Ahahahaha!",
    "SENTENCE_0873": "Are you sure you want to fight for someone with such an\r\nadmittedly spotty record in the trust department?",
    "SENTENCE_0874": "Next time, I could betray you for real.",
    "SENTENCE_0875": "Haha! Is that so? Perhaps we can puff out our chests at each other later,\r\nbut for now, let's work as a team—assuming you can keep up.",
    "SENTENCE_0876": "Trash deserves to be tossed, correct?",
    "SENTENCE_0877": "Humph. Are you sure that's wise? Because I have no\r\nintention of mending my wicked ways, you know.",
    "SENTENCE_0878": "Oh good. I can't wait to see you try.",
    "SENTENCE_0879": "To kill you two. What else?",
    "SENTENCE_0880": "Kill us? Oh, I'm terrified. Hahahaha! If only you know\r\nwith whom you were picking a fight...",
    "SENTENCE_0881": "Now that you're under my control, I shall push your power past its limits!",
    "SENTENCE_0882": "You were a fool to think you could control me.",
    "SENTENCE_0883": "You're starting to sweat, demon. Have you been taking this seriously or not?",
    "SENTENCE_0884": "I'll crush you in an instant!",
    "SENTENCE_0885": "Damn you... I don't need you to interfere!",
    "SENTENCE_0886": "Very well. Then this'll be a battle of raw strength alone.",
    "SENTENCE_0887": "For so long...my only goal has been to defeat you...",
    "SENTENCE_0888": "And I'll win then, too! I'm number one!",
    "SENTENCE_0889": "There's more... There has to be more to my power than this!",
    "SENTENCE_0890": "You've come at a good time. Fight me.",
    "SENTENCE_0891": "I-I'd be honored to, it's just...",
    "SENTENCE_0892": "Give me all you've got. Don't you dare hold back!",
    "SENTENCE_0893": "Whatever you want.",
    "SENTENCE_0894": "(That boy should serve as a good way to measure how much stronger I've become.)",
    "SENTENCE_0895": "Fine... But don't get angry if I beat you!",
    "SENTENCE_0896": "What are you jabbering about?! We're not finished yet!",
    "SENTENCE_0897": "Well, would you spar with me? I've realized that\r\ntraining all on my own isn't that helpful.",
    "SENTENCE_0898": "Fine. I've also noticed the limits of training by myself.",
    "SENTENCE_0899": "You've now officially blown your one chance you ever\r\nhad of defeating me! Hahahaha!",
    "SENTENCE_0900": "Oh, really? You're more impressive than I thought. So\r\nnice to know you weren't completely full of it.",
    "SENTENCE_0901": "Is that seriously all you've got? How disappointing...",
    "SENTENCE_0902": "And here you stand. Ready to give me another splendid show.",
    "SENTENCE_0903": "You must not disappoint me now.",
    "SENTENCE_0904": "This will be your first and final battle.\r\nDon't bother worrying about whose turn it is.",
    "SENTENCE_0905": "Yeah... You got that right.",
    "SENTENCE_0906": "Well done, I suppose. I mean, I went into this with low\r\nexpectations, so... consider me pleasantly surprised.",
    "SENTENCE_0907": "Heh! All right, then.",
    "SENTENCE_0908": "What's wrong? Are you gonna give up now? I think you\r\njust about hit your limits.",
    "SENTENCE_0909": "N...not yet... I'm not done...!",
    "SENTENCE_0910": "Fine. Killing you with this power was always my goal.",
    "SENTENCE_0911": "This time, there's going to be nothing left of you when I'm done!",
    "SENTENCE_0912": "(He's become ten times stronger than he was before...)",
    "SENTENCE_0913": "What's wrong? You don't seem so confident anymore.",
    "SENTENCE_0914": "Noooaaaaaaaah!",
    "SENTENCE_0915": "I never thought I'd be pushed this far by you!",
    "SENTENCE_0916": "Now what say we end this?!",
    "SENTENCE_0917": "Aaaaagh! No! This cannot be! I am... perfect!",
    "SENTENCE_0918": "Heh... Hehahaha! Hahahaha! That's what you get!",
    "SENTENCE_0919": "Time to die now! Huuh!",
    "SENTENCE_0920": "So that was it, then? I have to say, even for you that was a pretty dismal move.",
    "SENTENCE_0921": "Hohoho! Bravo, Vegeta. Your progress intrigues me.",
    "SENTENCE_0922": "I'm afraid you're going to have to go through me first.",
    "SENTENCE_0923": "Don't kid yourself! What makes you think you can take\r\nme now, Vegeta?",
    "SENTENCE_0924": "Oh, come off it with your fairy tales!",
    "SENTENCE_0925": "Now... you'll pay.",
    "SENTENCE_0926": "They always talk such a big talk, and then they end up\r\ndying so fast. It's a shame.",
    "SENTENCE_0927": "I've already seen one future ruined. I'm not gonna\r\nstand here and watch it happen again!",
    "SENTENCE_0928": "I suppose we'll see about that...but for now, I wonder\r\nif you would be so good as to assist me in warming up.",
    "SENTENCE_0929": "All right. Just know, I'll be turning up the heat rather quickly.",
    "SENTENCE_0930": "Here! If you have the guts to put that to the test...\r\nLet's see if you're \"perfect\" enough to withstand this!",
    "SENTENCE_0931": "Now let's just see what you can do!",
    "SENTENCE_0932": "Owww... That really hurt!",
    "SENTENCE_0933": "All right, time to hit him with everything I've got. \r\n'Cause if we lose this one, then the whole universe is history.",
    "SENTENCE_0934": "The final battle for the fate of the entire universe is about to begin!",
    "SENTENCE_0935": "You don't fight to win... You fight to keep pushing your own limits,\r\nand to never, ever lose!",
    "SENTENCE_0936": "(My body is quivering! Is this joy...or is it...)",
    "SENTENCE_0937": "Damn it! No matter what I do, he just keeps going and going, never tiring!",
    "SENTENCE_0938": "This is looking grim...",
    "SENTENCE_0939": "I won't let you have all the glory... We'll do it together...",
    "SENTENCE_0940": "You think you can beat me that easily?!",
    "SENTENCE_0941": "All right! That oughtta be the last of 'em!",
    "SENTENCE_0942": "Yes! We did it! We won!",
    "SENTENCE_0943": "Let me have a crack at 'em.",
    "SENTENCE_0944": "It's time I showed those thugs that no one comes to\r\nEarth and pushes us around!",
    "SENTENCE_0945": "This guy... Somehow he was draining my energy through his hand...",
    "SENTENCE_0946": "Hehehe! Better make it a good one, then!",
    "SENTENCE_0947": "Burst open and mix!",
    "SENTENCE_0948": "Aren't you going to heal your friends?",
    "SENTENCE_0949": "W-what is that form?",
    "SENTENCE_0950": "Have it your way. I'll only grow stronger so I can return and crush you\r\nonce and for all!",
    "SENTENCE_0951": "We'll see how long your strategicness keeps you alive.",
    "SENTENCE_0952": "Because it's all or nothing at this point. Plus, I've\r\ngot a plan, and I need everyone to pull it off.",
    "SENTENCE_0953": "I believe you, and I think we have no other choice but\r\nto join forces.",
    "SENTENCE_0954": "You wish to do battle with me, one on one?",
    "SENTENCE_0955": "That's for me to know... and you to find out.",
    "SENTENCE_0956": "Hilarious! Well finding out isn't exactly high on my to-do list.",
    "SENTENCE_0957": "It hardly matters anyway, since you'll soon be more\r\nbio-extract for me to drink up!",
    "SENTENCE_0958": "Ugh! That's enough. Now my clothes are all dirty...",
    "SENTENCE_0959": "Only let my guard down for a second...but you're something else.",
    "SENTENCE_0960": "Hehehehe... Touching, but sad to say I couldn't go back\r\neven if I wanted to.",
    "SENTENCE_0961": "Let's skip the pleasantries. We're here to take you down, simple as that.",
    "SENTENCE_0962": "Mrph... Maybe, but... It's the only way to beat you!",
    "SENTENCE_0963": "Sorry to keep you waiting. Are you ready?",
    "SENTENCE_0964": "What, you gonna throw a fit, small fry? Go right ahead.",
    "SENTENCE_0965": "Hahaha! That stupid look on your face just makes me\r\nwant to kill you faster!",
    "SENTENCE_0966": "In other words...you were cast out like a dog!",
    "SENTENCE_0967": "Hahahaha! That's a nice attempt at a joke. Now let me show you a wall that you\r\nwill never have the ability to scale through effort alone!",
    "SENTENCE_0968": "Believe it or not, that's good news. The energy that\r\nradiates from a god cannot be detected by mere mortals.",
    "SENTENCE_0969": "Finally. This is what I've been waiting for.",
    "SENTENCE_0970": "What do you say we continue this fight on equal\r\nfooting, god to god?",
    "SENTENCE_0971": "That's well-deduced for a simpleton. I've held back\r\njust like you.",
    "SENTENCE_0972": "Either way, this battle's sure to be interesting.",
    "SENTENCE_0973": "Fool! Change now!",
    "SENTENCE_0974": "That actually hurt! You've made me feel pain!",
    "SENTENCE_0975": "Then do you wanna finish this, or are you just gonna keep talking?",
    "SENTENCE_0976": "You must die by my hand!",
    "SENTENCE_0977": "You fool!",
    "SENTENCE_0978": "Ugaaaaah!",
    "SENTENCE_0979": "Well, well, well... It appears that outrageous monster\r\nis finally joining the fray...",
    "SENTENCE_0980": "Yes, who would have thought that one mortal warrior\r\ncould release this much energy?",
    "SENTENCE_0981": "Then I guess I'll have to crank it up!",
    "SENTENCE_0982": "Ka... me...",
    "SENTENCE_0983": "Ha... me...",
    "SENTENCE_0984": "Haaa!",
    "SENTENCE_0985": "He's got Goku pinned down...",
    "SENTENCE_0986": "It's astounding... This mortal really is something else.\r\nLook at that brilliant form. There can be no doubt. This is...",
    "SENTENCE_0987": "That power is ferocious! Like a firestorm!",
    "SENTENCE_0988": "Humph. That sickening naivete of yours is what I quite\r\ndespise most of all... but for my own self-interest, I\r\nshould probably thank you.",
    "SENTENCE_0989": "I... I don't believe it... Look at him...",
    "SENTENCE_0990": "The earring! Give it here!",
    "SENTENCE_0991": "Haaaaaaaaaa!",
    "SENTENCE_0992": "It's on! Now what?!",
    "SENTENCE_0993": "(All right... Let's hope this plan's crazy enough to work...)",
    "SENTENCE_0994": "I can already tell, I'm going to be sleeping soundly tonight.",
    "SENTENCE_0995": "My wait is almost over.",
    "SENTENCE_0996": "Hate to burst your bubble, but there's no way I'm\r\nletting you two get what you want!",
    "SENTENCE_0997": "Who knows? But no matter what, I will make him pay for\r\neverything he's done!",
    "SENTENCE_0998": "The truth is, it's only permanent if a Supreme Kai is\r\ninvolved. Otherwise, it only lasts an hour.",
    "SENTENCE_0999": "All of existence... go away!",
    "SENTENCE_1000": "Good. I think my combat instincts are starting to come\r\nback to me.",
    "SENTENCE_1001": "Do you honestly believe I'm going to let you defeat me?",
    "SENTENCE_1002": "It's your fault... that everyone has had to suffer!",
    "SENTENCE_1003": "Ahahaha! I've left you utterly speechless!",
    "SENTENCE_1004": "If you surrender now, I might be merciful enough to\r\nkeep your suffering to a minimum, but no promises!",
    "SENTENCE_1005": "Surrender? Not in a million years.",
    "SENTENCE_1006": "Awesome! You took it to 'em, Gohan!",
    "SENTENCE_1007": "Thanks, guys...but...it was a close call...",
    "SENTENCE_1008": "This is horrible. It's like... I'm fighting an evil\r\nreflection of myself.",
    "SENTENCE_1009": "But why? Why does he even exist?",
    "SENTENCE_1010": "You're right. We go together!",
    "SENTENCE_1011": "Gimme some room! He's mine!",
    "SENTENCE_1012": "Sure you don't need some help with this guy?",
    "SENTENCE_1013": "I'm not a kid anymore!",
    "SENTENCE_1014": "Suit yourself.",
    "SENTENCE_1015": "Humph. Not bad, boy.",
    "SENTENCE_1016": "For now, let's work as a team. Assuming you can keep up.",
    "SENTENCE_1017": "You think your trivial cause can compete with a Destroyer's resolve?\r\nI ordain what will and will not exist. That's my cause. And to serve it,\r\nI will forsake all else.",
    "SENTENCE_1018": "Humph. Then let's do this!",
    "SENTENCE_1019": "Whoa... W-we won, guys!",
    "SENTENCE_1020": "Why are we fighting? There's no point... We can just\r\nstop. Look, I'm giving you the chance to end this\r\nwithout violence. I really don't want to kill you.",
    "SENTENCE_1021": "For as long as I can remember, whenever I got real\r\nmad...things would happen around me that I couldn't\r\nexplain... Crazy things.",
    "SENTENCE_1022": "Seize upon your anger... Wield it like a weapon. I\r\nunderstand your reluctance, but holding it in is pointless.",
    "SENTENCE_1023": "Gohan... I love the animals and everything about\r\nnature. Protect them, for me. They need you.",
    "SENTENCE_1024": "Know what? Now I actually feel sorry for you.",
    "SENTENCE_1025": "Damn it... It's all my fault... I could've ended this, but I didn't!",
    "SENTENCE_1026": "I'd have given anything for a chance to do it over\r\nagain... Now I get one.",
    "SENTENCE_1027": "Then let's see if you've got the power to back up your\r\nwords... Luck won't be on your side this time.",
    "SENTENCE_1028": "But the game is over now... And it's about time I\r\nwrapped this show up!",
    "SENTENCE_1029": "Ngh... Like I'm... the kinda gal... to give up!",
    "SENTENCE_1030": "He's gonna pay!",
    "SENTENCE_1031": "That's it. This match is over!",
    "SENTENCE_1032": "...You feel it too? Such an incredibly powerful ki...!",
    "SENTENCE_1033": "But, we can't fight this thing either! What...what in\r\nthe blazes should we do...?!",
    "SENTENCE_1034": "Yes. Sage advice. Let's take a break.",
    "SENTENCE_1035": "...I agree. I'm going to continue my pursuit of the martial arts.",
    "SENTENCE_1036": "What for? Their power levels are less than nothin'.\r\nLet's just slaughter 'em right here and now.",
    "SENTENCE_1037": "I got a feeling they're not just here to say hi.",
    "SENTENCE_1038": "It might take a while to explain...and it's probably dangerous to do it here.",
    "SENTENCE_1039": "If you think you can escape me now, you're sadly mistaken!",
    "SENTENCE_1040": "I will prove that all our training, our pursuit of the\r\nmartial arts,\r\nhas not been a waste!",
    "SENTENCE_1041": "...Do you think we can we fight again someday? The two of us, in a rematch?",
    "SENTENCE_1042": "There's nothing I can do! It's hopeless!",
    "SENTENCE_1043": "You've tried my patience long enough! Prepare to be erased, cueball!",
    "SENTENCE_1044": "I need to buy as much time as I possibly can...!",
    "SENTENCE_1045": "What are you doing?! Get out of here!",
    "SENTENCE_1046": "What's worse, dying or standing here and doing nothing\r\nwhile Gohan is out there all alone fighting to protect us?",
    "SENTENCE_1047": "Last one in's a rotten egg, huh?",
    "SENTENCE_1048": "This is for all the people you've terrorized over the\r\nyears, and for all the lives you've taken.",
    "SENTENCE_1049": "All their hopes and sorrows will become my strength!",
    "SENTENCE_1050": "Very well... You have left me with no other choice! I\r\nshall let my hatred for you mortals become my strength!",
    "SENTENCE_1051": "Learn the depths of my rage, mortals, and taste true\r\ndespair! You all deserve to die!",
    "SENTENCE_1052": "Be prepared! Here they come!",
    "SENTENCE_1053": "Channel your willpower into an explosion of rage! Break past your limits!",
    "SENTENCE_1054": "Thank you for training with me, everyone... You don't\r\nknow how much this means to me.",
    "SENTENCE_1055": "So you could truly ask for anything you want!",
    "SENTENCE_1056": "Not just to you! I won't lose to anyone!",
    "SENTENCE_1057": "Take care of yourselves, everyone. I promise we'll meet again someday!",
    "SENTENCE_1058": "Point being, if you don't put aside your trauma,\r\nthey're going to eat you alive.",
    "SENTENCE_1059": "Or, if you really can't deal with it, we could always\r\njust step away and let you fly solo.",
    "SENTENCE_1060": "No... I'm grateful for your help, you two!",
    "SENTENCE_1061": "Then that's all the more reason we can't lose!",
    "SENTENCE_1062": "Sinner?",
    "SENTENCE_1063": "There's one thing we agree on... This world can be a\r\nparadise, but it belongs to us alone! And we will\r\ncreate it, not you!",
    "SENTENCE_1064": "Energy... it's flowing in from every living thing in this world!",
    "SENTENCE_1065": "I can feel it... Keep it coming, you guys! Share your\r\npower with me!",
    "SENTENCE_1066": "No... You're a mere mortal!",
    "SENTENCE_1067": "It's not about gods and mortals! You don't believe in\r\nanything but yourself! And we won't let you win!",
    "SENTENCE_1068": "(What should I do now...?)",
    "SENTENCE_1069": "I'll get stronger... Just you wait and see!",
    "SENTENCE_1070": "Well, well... And I've only just been getting warmed up!",
    "SENTENCE_1071": "Oh, well excuse me!",
    "SENTENCE_1072": "Whoo!",
    "SENTENCE_1073": "Try not to wet yourself when you see my full strength on display.",
    "SENTENCE_1074": "Thanks to you, my power will only grow to greater heights!",
    "SENTENCE_1075": "Then that's enough reason to take you on.",
    "SENTENCE_1076": "Meh. Nothing to write home about.",
    "SENTENCE_1077": "All right... I think I've humored you long enough.",
    "SENTENCE_1078": "Which means unfortunately for you, that little ruse only succeeded in pissing me off!",
    "SENTENCE_1079": "Agh, damn it! That was fast.",
    "SENTENCE_1080": "I don't need any second-rate joker.",
    "SENTENCE_1081": "Oho ho! Fascinating!",
    "SENTENCE_1082": "You're so slow, I can't help but be a little bored.",
    "SENTENCE_1083": "I will face you!",
    "SENTENCE_1084": "Watch my superb technique!",
    "SENTENCE_1085": "Sorry, it's up to you now...",
    "SENTENCE_1086": "Pretty cool, right?! I spent a bunch of time thinking it up!",
    "SENTENCE_1087": "I'm your final opponent.",
    "SENTENCE_1088": "I won't hold back!",
    "SENTENCE_1089": "Hmm...",
    "SENTENCE_1090": "You pass!",
    "SENTENCE_1091": "Thank you!",
    "SENTENCE_1092": "Not bad.",
    "SENTENCE_1093": "Even so...",
    "SENTENCE_1094": "Still got a long way to go...",
    "SENTENCE_1095": "I hear your resolve loud and clear.",
    "SENTENCE_1096": "You can try again.",
    "SENTENCE_1097": "I've been looking for someone like you... Someone who could surpass me...",
    "SENTENCE_1098": "Let's have a bit of fun.",
    "SENTENCE_1099": "Maybe we should end things here as it seems like you have a customer.",
    "SENTENCE_1100": "This ki... It can't be...!",
    "SENTENCE_1101": "Whoa, this ki...!",
    "SENTENCE_1102": "I'm not just zoning out, here...",
    "SENTENCE_1103": "Let's see how strong you've gotten since then.",
    "SENTENCE_1104": "Heh heh... Incredible...",
    "SENTENCE_1105": "Try to become strong enough to surpass me... And then, I'll will just surpass you again!",
    "SENTENCE_1106": "Say...",
    "SENTENCE_1107": "You know a bunch of troublesome folks, huh?",
    "SENTENCE_1108": "Ahahaha...",
    "SENTENCE_1109": "I've been found out, huh...",
    "SENTENCE_1110": "Get strong as fast as you can and then come for me.\r\nI'll be killing everyone in the meanwhile.",
    "SENTENCE_1111": "Just hanging onto life, huh...",
    "SENTENCE_1112": "All right... We'll try it!",
    "SENTENCE_1113": "Ah! Oh no!",
    "SENTENCE_1114": "Oh...?",
    "SENTENCE_1115": "You haven't learned, have you?",
    "SENTENCE_1116": "I won't be bested so easily this time.",
    "SENTENCE_1117": "Just who is that supposed to be?",
    "SENTENCE_1118": "Give it a shot!",
    "SENTENCE_1119": "Never thought you'd hang on for this long...",
    "SENTENCE_1120": "Just don't know when to quit, huh?",
    "SENTENCE_1121": "I suppose I should finally take you seriously!",
    "SENTENCE_1122": "Um...!",
    "SENTENCE_1123": "It's...inside of me...!",
    "SENTENCE_1124": "...?",
    "SENTENCE_1125": "What does that mean?",
    "SENTENCE_1126": "I don't know.",
    "SENTENCE_1127": "That's what I was afraid of...",
    "SENTENCE_1128": "Why am I...?",
    "SENTENCE_1129": "Humph... That's not good.\r\nI'll go take a look.",
    "SENTENCE_1130": "Are you sure?!",
    "SENTENCE_1131": "So boring.",
    "SENTENCE_1132": "You're really putting in the work.",
    "SENTENCE_1133": "Hmm. Wonder if I can help at all...",
    "SENTENCE_1134": "Please, don't lose!",
    "SENTENCE_1135": "What can we do about this!",
    "SENTENCE_1136": "That appearance... Do try your best not to bore me.",
    "SENTENCE_1137": "Yeah, don't be so shocked.",
    "SENTENCE_1138": "Humph... That has nothing to do with me.",
    "SENTENCE_1139": "I can see right through your moves!",
    "SENTENCE_1140": "More where that came from!",
    "SENTENCE_1141": "Such a slowpoke.",
    "SENTENCE_1142": "Here, take this.",
    "SENTENCE_1143": "U-um...",
    "SENTENCE_1144": "I guess the usual should work just fine...",
    "SENTENCE_1145": "Impressive.",
    "SENTENCE_1146": "I thought you were little more than a clown at first.",
    "SENTENCE_1147": "Wait a minute!",
    "SENTENCE_1148": "And this is a favorite of mine that Bulma made, you know!",
    "SENTENCE_1149": "How's this?",
    "SENTENCE_1150": "Suitable for a new warrior of justice, wouldn't you say?",
    "SENTENCE_1151": "Yeah, what incredible power...",
    "SENTENCE_1152": "Now then, let's protect the peace of the universe together...",
    "SENTENCE_1153": "Well...you'll need to beat me first!",
    "SENTENCE_1154": "I can see how tired you are.",
    "SENTENCE_1155": "N-no...",
    "SENTENCE_1156": "The Great Saiyaman can't give up so easily!",
    "SENTENCE_1157": "Humph.",
    "SENTENCE_1158": "Calling all challengers!\r\nAny fighters out there who think they've got what it takes?",
    "SENTENCE_1159": "We're currently accepting new entries, so hurry on over\r\nand sign up!",
    "SENTENCE_1160": "The fiercest fighters have gathered here today!",
    "SENTENCE_1161": "Oh, feel like joining the fray this time?",

    "SENTENCE_1163": "Okay, we'll check you in right away.",
    "SENTENCE_1164": "The tournament will begin soon. Do what you gotta do to get ready.",
    "SENTENCE_1165": "We have a winner! How about a round of applause for\r\nboth fighters?",
    "SENTENCE_1166": "This contestant made it through some fierce battles to claim their\r\nwell-earned glory! Amazing! Congratulations on your victory!",
    "SENTENCE_1167": "Congratulations! You're the champion!",
    "SENTENCE_1168": "Wow! That was an incredible fight! You really are the best!",
    "SENTENCE_1169": "All righty, that's the end of the Other World Tournament!\r\nAll of the competitors showed real moxie out there!",
    "SENTENCE_1170": "Yes, yes, congratulations to you! You're the winner! I\r\nhope we get to see you at\r\nthe next tournament!",
    "SENTENCE_1171": "Ah, just as I expected. You've emerged victorious!",
    "SENTENCE_1172": "You're the best! Congratulations on the victory!",
    "SENTENCE_1173": "Aw man, I lost! Congrats, looks like you're the winner!",
    "SENTENCE_1174": "Whew! I worked up a real sweat! You win. Let's go again soon!",
    "SENTENCE_1175": "Now then, here's the inaugural match!",
    "SENTENCE_1176": "Next up is this exciting match!",
    "SENTENCE_1177": "For the next match, here are our contestants!",
    "SENTENCE_1178": "Sorry for the delay, folks! Let's get to it and start the next match!",
    "SENTENCE_1179": "All right, folks! Now, let's see how our next match is\r\ngonna heat up!",
    "SENTENCE_1180": "We've finally made it to the semifinals! Start it up!",
    "SENTENCE_1181": "The winners will advance to the final round, so keep\r\nyour eyes open for the stunning outcome!",
    "SENTENCE_1182": "This is it! The long-awaited finals are here!",
    "SENTENCE_1183": "This battle will determine the strongest martial artist\r\nin the world! Let the final round begin!",
    "SENTENCE_1184": "This is the last chance for any loser to leave with\r\ntheir lives... It's time to fight!",
    "SENTENCE_1185": "Is there no one left here who can entertain me?\r\nCommence with the next match!",
    "SENTENCE_1186": "Try not to die too quickly, please. Now, start fighting!",
    "SENTENCE_1187": "There are only a few matches in the tournament left,\r\nfolks! It's time for the semifinals!",
    "SENTENCE_1188": "Mwahahaha! This is actually starting to get fun!\r\nNow, which of you will prove themselves worthy of fighting me?",
    "SENTENCE_1189": "The winner of this match will earn the honor of\r\nchallenging yours truly. Like\r\nyou stand a chance in hell! Hahaha!",
    "SENTENCE_1190": "Ohhh, I've been waiting for this. Which one of you\r\nidiots will give me a good fight?",
    "SENTENCE_1191": "First, you will determine who is the strongest fighter among you.\r\nAlthough, it won't matter in the end since none of you can beat me! Hahaha!",
    "SENTENCE_1192": "Hmm. Why do you look exactly like me? You're so\r\nhandsome! I wonder what would\r\nhappen if you and I were to fight.",
    "SENTENCE_1193": "Copying me so you can enter the competition, huh? Well,\r\nI suppose \"fake it until\r\nyou make it\" is one way to get ahead!",
    "SENTENCE_1194": "Oh, I get it. You're copying my look to throw your opponent off their game, right?\r\nSorry to burst your bubble, but the real deal is here!",
    "SENTENCE_1195": "Hmmm, I wonder who's gonna win?",
    "SENTENCE_1196": "The next match is about to begin. Are you sufficiently prepared?",
    "SENTENCE_1197": "Keep showing us fun fights! Don't disappoint us, now!",
    "SENTENCE_1198": "Fighters for the next match, you may now enter the arena.",
    "SENTENCE_1199": "The winner of this match will go on to fight in the finals!\r\nDo your best, everyone!",
    "SENTENCE_1200": "This fight shall determine who will continue on to the\r\nfinals. Please give it\r\nyour very best and hold nothing back.",
    "SENTENCE_1201": "It's time for the finals! Who's gonna win? I'm so excited!",
    "SENTENCE_1202": "We have at last reached the final match. I wonder who\r\nwill emerge victorious.",
    "SENTENCE_1203": "Let's see here, which fighter is up first... Hey! You ready?",
    "SENTENCE_1204": "The fighters for the next match better finish their warm-up soon!",
    "SENTENCE_1205": "Hehe! That's what I'm talkin' about! Things are\r\nstartin' to heat up!",
    "SENTENCE_1206": "Oh ho! This one's quite the matchup... Now then, let's begin!",
    "SENTENCE_1207": "Hmm, so it's these two fighters stepping up. Okay,\r\neveryone! We're moving on to\r\nthe next match!",
    "SENTENCE_1208": "If you win this fight, you're in the finals. Give it\r\nyour best shot!",
    "SENTENCE_1209": "Wow! That's quite the lineup of powerhouses we've got\r\nhere. Now we're talking!",
    "SENTENCE_1210": "The finals are about to begin, folks! Oh, that reminds me.\r\nI completely forgot to think of a prize for the winner. Hm...",
    "SENTENCE_1211": "Whatever you do, you better not bore me. Understood?",
    "SENTENCE_1212": "Okay! Give it everything you've got from the start!",
    "SENTENCE_1213": "I've chosen to back you, so don't screw this up!",
    "SENTENCE_1214": "Keep at it! Push through and seize victory!",
    "SENTENCE_1215": "We're starting the next match! Finish this one off quickly.\r\nDon't keep me waiting!",
    "SENTENCE_1216": "Okay, which one of you is fighting next? Don't disappoint me!",
    "SENTENCE_1217": "Hey, you've made it this far already. You can at least\r\nget to the finals!",
    "SENTENCE_1219": "Every match so far has been quite enjoyable...\r\nbut this is starting to test my patience!",
    "SENTENCE_1220": "Whoa! Things are heating up! Let's see which of these\r\nfighters comes out on top!",
    "SENTENCE_1222": "Hey! If you insist on looking like me, you better not lose!",
    "SENTENCE_1223": "Hm? Well, I see at least one familiar face out there.",
    "SENTENCE_1224": "What's this? Somebody who's as cool as I am?",
    "SENTENCE_1225": "Huh, how many matches are left? Ah, who cares! Let's get goin'!",
    "SENTENCE_1226": "Stay frosty, 'cause there's still a long road to\r\nvictory. Fight hard, and fight\r\nwell! Let the match begin!",
    "SENTENCE_1227": "Here's who you'll be fighting next! Better make it a good one!",
    "SENTENCE_1228": "Who should I root for? If I'm smart, I oughtta pick the\r\none I got an actual chance against...",
    "SENTENCE_1229": "Hmm, we've got some real tough contenders for this\r\none.\r\nOkay, let the semifinals begin!",
    "SENTENCE_1230": "You've almost reached the finals! Don't drop your guard now!",
    "SENTENCE_1231": "Egh... both those fighters look pretty tough. And, uh,\r\nI have to fight one of them!",
    "SENTENCE_1232": "Wow, they're so strong! Guess that means I'm up next!",
    "SENTENCE_1233": "Come on! Who's gonna get to fight me? I can't wait to\r\nsee who it is!",
    "SENTENCE_1234": "You've done well to make it this far. I'm the final\r\nobstacle! Bring it!",
    "SENTENCE_1235": "This one kinda reminds me of me. Maybe I should root for them...",
    "SENTENCE_1236": "Hmm, if someone just as handsome as me wins, they're\r\ngonna totally show me up!",
    "SENTENCE_1237": "And that concludes the match! It looks like fate has\r\nsmiled upon our winner!",
    "SENTENCE_1238": "And the match is over! Who could've predicted this outcome?!",
    "SENTENCE_1239": "After an incredible performance, we have our clear winner!",
    "SENTENCE_1240": "Victory by a landslide! Just look at their professional disposition!",
    "SENTENCE_1241": "Oh! A signature technique!",
    "SENTENCE_1242": "Incredible! A clean hit with the contestant's super attack!",
    "SENTENCE_1243": "Out of bounds! We have a winner!",
    "SENTENCE_1244": "Out of bounds! And that's the match!",
    "SENTENCE_1245": "The clock is ticking, folks!",
    "SENTENCE_1246": "You could cut this tension with a knife!",
    "SENTENCE_1247": "Not much time left now, ladies and gentlemen!",
    "SENTENCE_1248": "Let's see how this match shakes out in its few\r\nremaining moments!",
    "SENTENCE_1249": "And that's time! The match is over!",
    "SENTENCE_1250": "Whoops! Looks like we're out of time, folks!",
    "SENTENCE_1251": "Oh no... Looks like that was the last of their strength!",
    "SENTENCE_1252": "Yowza! Looks like someone's at their limit!",
    "SENTENCE_1253": "Looks like the contestants are switching out!",
    "SENTENCE_1254": "And the next contestant has taken the stage!",
    "SENTENCE_1255": "Ah! Oh no! Folks, should I maybe get the heck outta here?!",
    "SENTENCE_1256": "Fighters are switching out to accommodate the matchup...",
    "SENTENCE_1257": "It seems they've lost sight of their opponent!",
    "SENTENCE_1258": "A successful first blow!",
    "SENTENCE_1259": "Look at that stunning barrage of attacks!",
    "SENTENCE_1260": "The pressure's on, everybody!",
    "SENTENCE_1261": "This is gonna be a big one!",
    "SENTENCE_1262": "It's like they teleported! My eyes couldn't even follow it!",
    "SENTENCE_1263": "That's gotta hurt!",
    "SENTENCE_1264": "What a sense of balance!",
    "SENTENCE_1265": "They've become even stronger!",
    "SENTENCE_1266": "Nice dodging!",
    "SENTENCE_1267": "This is unbelievable!",
    "SENTENCE_1268": "Will this attack change the flow of battle?!",
    "SENTENCE_1269": "An explosive signature move!",
    "SENTENCE_1270": "Oh, hold your breath! Something major's about to happen!",
    "SENTENCE_1271": "Can they withstand such an incredible attack?",
    "SENTENCE_1272": "No payoff for that one!",
    "SENTENCE_1273": "Caution's been throw to the wind, ladies and gentlemen!",
    "SENTENCE_1274": "That attack's putting it all on the line!",
    "SENTENCE_1275": "The contestant has transformed! This oughta shake things up!",
    "SENTENCE_1276": "Oh, it missed!",
    "SENTENCE_1277": "Looks like the powers of these two have now become one!",
    "SENTENCE_1278": "This could be it, folks!",
    "SENTENCE_1279": "A fierce attack!",
    "SENTENCE_1280": "Oooh! That was a major hit!",
    "SENTENCE_1281": "Whoops! Just a smidge too slow for that one!",
    "SENTENCE_1282": "Oh! It's a clean hit, folks!",
    "SENTENCE_1283": "Raw strength alone won't be the deciding factor of this one!",
    "SENTENCE_1284": "And the attack was shut down! Incredible!",
    "SENTENCE_1285": "They... They disappeared!",
    "SENTENCE_1286": "Oh my gosh! That last attack sent them flying!",
    "SENTENCE_1287": "Who else can stand after that attack?!",
    "SENTENCE_1288": "A firm reminder to know when to quit!",
    "SENTENCE_1289": "These fighters just might be evenly matched!",
    "SENTENCE_1290": "This fierce fighter has a clear advantage over their opponent!",
    "SENTENCE_1291": "This is quickly turning into a one-sided battle!",
    "SENTENCE_1292": "How will they dodge this one?",
    "SENTENCE_1293": "Their opponent can't seem to keep up with such rapid movements!",
    "SENTENCE_1294": "This vigorous onslaught just can't be stopped!",
    "SENTENCE_1295": "This could be a chance for a counterattack!",
    "SENTENCE_1296": "What a dizzying exchange of offense and defense!",
    "SENTENCE_1297": "Completely at their mercy! And their opponent's not\r\n letting up for even a second!",
    "SENTENCE_1298": "Holy moly! Look how much they've powered up!",
    "SENTENCE_1299": "The contestants are swapping out!",
    "SENTENCE_1300": "Uh-oh, folks... One of the fighters looks to be hiding!",
    "SENTENCE_1301": "They've found their foe! And I doubt they'll let them\r\nout of their sights again!",
    "SENTENCE_1302": "A solid defense! Would've been quite a light show, though!",
    "SENTENCE_1303": "Whoa! They're powering up!",
    "SENTENCE_1304": "Someone's getting serious! Were they just putting on an act before?!",
    "SENTENCE_1305": "Their clothes have been torn to shreds!",
    "SENTENCE_1306": "That far-reaching attack's got the crowd shaking in their seats!",
    "SENTENCE_1307": "Not even their own clothing can withstand this intense combat!",
    "SENTENCE_1308": "That was a brutal attack if I've ever seen one!",
    "SENTENCE_1309": "Double damage!",
    "SENTENCE_1310": "Hold your breath! This could be the end, ladies and gentlemen!",
    "SENTENCE_1311": "The action is so quick, I wonder if the audience can keep up!",
    "SENTENCE_1312": "That was a close one!",
    "SENTENCE_1313": "Did you all see that?!",
    "SENTENCE_1314": "Will this turn the very tide of the fight?!",
    "SENTENCE_1315": "This is just child's play for these skilled martial artists!",
    "SENTENCE_1316": "They dodged that without breaking a sweat!",
    "SENTENCE_1317": "They've been spotted, with their opponent's sights set on them!",
    "SENTENCE_1318": "If this hits, it could be over!",
    "SENTENCE_1319": "Here we go! No holds barred, folks!",
    "SENTENCE_1320": "Oh no! Looks like a fumble!",
    "SENTENCE_1321": "Hehehehe! Very well, that settles it!",
    "SENTENCE_1322": "I can't believe an attack that tremendous could be blocked!",
    "SENTENCE_1323": "Hmm. I hadn't expected such exceptional results.",
    "SENTENCE_1324": "Hehehe... An excellent technique. I'll have to steal that one.",
    "SENTENCE_1325": "The smackdown continues!",
    "SENTENCE_1326": "Losing by ringout! How pedestrian!",
    "SENTENCE_1327": "I wonder... How will this battle shake out?",
    "SENTENCE_1328": "You won't stop me that easily.",
    "SENTENCE_1329": "Whoa, uh, maybe I'll, uh, check things out from a bit\r\nfarther away... Hehe...heh...",
    "SENTENCE_1330": "Hmm... I don't have time to waste.",
    "SENTENCE_1331": "(That cannot be...)",
    "SENTENCE_1332": "How ridiculous. I'm ready to end this battle.",
    "SENTENCE_1333": "This one's stronger than I thought...",
    "SENTENCE_1334": "Humph! Is that the extent of your power?",
    "SENTENCE_1335": "I don't know...",
    "SENTENCE_1336": "You good? You ain't dead, are ya?",
    "SENTENCE_1337": "Do try to not disappoint me next time.",
    "SENTENCE_1338": "Hehehehe... This should be interesting.",
    "SENTENCE_1339": "What's this?",
    "SENTENCE_1340": "And it missed!",
    "SENTENCE_1341": "Oh, it seems you mean to finish this in one go.",
    "SENTENCE_1342": "Whoa... I couldn't follow that at all!",
    "SENTENCE_1343": "Oof. That looks like it hurt.",
    "SENTENCE_1344": "Hurled straight into the stratosphere!",
    "SENTENCE_1345": "Oooh. Powered up now, are we?",
    "SENTENCE_1346": "It's not over for this fighter!",
    "SENTENCE_1347": "Honestly, I can't even tell what's different about that.",
    "SENTENCE_1348": "Gotta hand it to you. Pretty nice moves.",
    "SENTENCE_1349": "Well, I can handle that much for sure!",
    "SENTENCE_1350": "Hmm. Not bad.",
    "SENTENCE_1351": "The tougher contestant might be made clear in just a moment!",
    "SENTENCE_1352": "Whoa! Where'd that come from?! Give a guy a heads-up first!",
    "SENTENCE_1353": "Come on! Show me your best move!",
    "SENTENCE_1354": "These contestants are so on par with each other,\r\nit's hard to know which one to root for!",
    "SENTENCE_1355": "Eyahahaha! Simply magnificent!",
    "SENTENCE_1356": "Ahh! Stay back! Don't come any closer!",
    "SENTENCE_1357": "Self-destruction? Feeling a little inadequate, are we?",
    "SENTENCE_1358": "Hold on a minute... What the heck just happened?",
    "SENTENCE_1359": "Waaaah! Stop it! No! Whatever you do, don't hurt me!",
    "SENTENCE_1360": "Hehehe... Change your form as much as you want.",
    "SENTENCE_1361": "That attack was simply unstoppable! What a hit!",
    "SENTENCE_1362": "I gotta be honest, I don't know what in the world I'm lookin' at.",
    "SENTENCE_1363": "So, you figured out you can't win on your own, huh?",
    "SENTENCE_1364": "Oooh! Good hit!",
    "SENTENCE_1365": "Yes, good! Keep that up!",
    "SENTENCE_1366": "Idiot. You let your guard down.",
    "SENTENCE_1367": "Oooh! Harsh blow!",
    "SENTENCE_1368": "What a dirty trick! I'd never stoop that low!",
    "SENTENCE_1369": "What's going on? Why can't I keep up with your speed?",
    "SENTENCE_1370": "Looks like you're coming up a bit short in the power department.",
    "SENTENCE_1371": "Ohoho, really? Do you think that's enough for me to give in?",
    "SENTENCE_1372": "What a ruthless blow!",
    "SENTENCE_1373": "Hehehe! You let your guard down.",
    "SENTENCE_1374": "Only cowards run away from a challenge.",
    "SENTENCE_1375": "Oh, come on, man! Taggin' out is for cowards! It's the\r\nsign of a real amateur.",
    "SENTENCE_1376": "I wonder which one of you will make it all the way to\r\nthe finals to face me.",
    "SENTENCE_1377": "Ugh. The overwhelming difference in our power levels\r\nmakes this so boring!",
    "SENTENCE_1378": "You're pretty quick on your feet.",
    "SENTENCE_1379": "After striking a bizarre pose, the contestants have merged into a single fighter!",
    "SENTENCE_1380": "Gee! J-just what in the heck are these guys?!",
    "SENTENCE_1381": "Good! Like that!",
    "SENTENCE_1382": "Whoa! The contestant is transforming!",
    "SENTENCE_1383": "Look at 'em rush right in! Hehe... Looks like\r\nsomebody's a little impatient.",
    "SENTENCE_1384": "You're up to something. I can tell.",
    "SENTENCE_1385": "How splendid! Your footwork is excellent!",
    "SENTENCE_1386": "W-well, I could do somethin' like that just as easily!\r\nHehe... Hehehe... Yeah.",
    "SENTENCE_1387": "All right, that settles it! That fighter's my new top disciple!",
    "SENTENCE_1388": "Hmm. Maybe I should take you a little seriously.",
    "SENTENCE_1389": "What in the world?! The contestants have somehow fused\r\nthemselves together!",
    "SENTENCE_1390": "What are you doing?",
    "SENTENCE_1391": "Whoa! They've been pushed back!",
    "SENTENCE_1392": "Yes! Like that!",
    "SENTENCE_1393": "What a crying shame!",
    "SENTENCE_1394": "Have they tapped into the depths of their hidden power?!",
    "SENTENCE_1395": "Gross. It's amazing how unsightly you've become.",
    "SENTENCE_1396": "And after all that effort I put into building this arena, too...",
    "SENTENCE_1397": "Perfect! A fantastic move!",
    "SENTENCE_1398": "Oh jeez... If I stay here any longer, I'll end up dead!",
    "SENTENCE_1399": "Uh, well I'll just... take a couple of steps back...",
    "SENTENCE_1400": "Get up! That amount of pain shouldn't keep you down, weakling!",
    "SENTENCE_1401": "What did I tell ya? That's what happens when you start\r\ngettin' too fancy. Humph.",
    "SENTENCE_1402": "Hm... Evenly matched, I see.",
    "SENTENCE_1403": "This is one flashy smackdown!",
    "SENTENCE_1404": "That's right. Don't give them a chance to strike back!",
    "SENTENCE_1405": "Whoa, whoa, whoa... You aren't done, are you?",
    "SENTENCE_1406": "Knocked right out of the park!",
    "SENTENCE_1407": "How were they able to break their fall from that position?\r\nIt doesn't make sense!",
    "SENTENCE_1408": "Good. Seems like you're starting to get the hang of it",
    "SENTENCE_1409": "Eyahahaha! Ooh, that tickles! It's so adorable!",
    "SENTENCE_1410": "Guess that one wasn't very effective!",
    "SENTENCE_1411": "You managed to dodge that? Very nice.",
    "SENTENCE_1412": "Saw through that one like a window!",
    "SENTENCE_1413": "You're a slippery one, aren't you?",
    "SENTENCE_1414": "Ah! An excellent dodge!",
    "SENTENCE_1415": "Both fighters have been sent flying!",
    "SENTENCE_1416": "What a fun match!",
    "SENTENCE_1417": "Goodness, what a knockout! That concludes the match.",
    "SENTENCE_1418": "Wow! An overwhelming victory!",
    "SENTENCE_1419": "That's enough!",
    "SENTENCE_1420": "Wow! That was so cool!",
    "SENTENCE_1421": "What a remarkable attack.",
    "SENTENCE_1422": "Uh-oh! Someone's out of bounds!",
    "SENTENCE_1423": "Out of bounds! This match is over!",
    "SENTENCE_1424": "I can't look away from the action!",
    "SENTENCE_1425": "Heh... Time is slipping away. Better hurry.",
    "SENTENCE_1426": "Hurry up! Time's about to run out!",
    "SENTENCE_1427": "Uh-oh... You don't have much time left.",
    "SENTENCE_1428": "Time's up! Sorry, but them's the rules!",
    "SENTENCE_1429": "Time's up! All fighters, stop! We'll let the judges decide.",
    "SENTENCE_1430": "Oh, dear. That was hard to watch...",
    "SENTENCE_1431": "That was quite a knockout!",
    "SENTENCE_1432": "Okay. Who's next?",
    "SENTENCE_1433": "Very well. Next fighters, please enter the ring!",
    "SENTENCE_1434": "Go! Go!",
    "SENTENCE_1435": "Now that's a bold start.",
    "SENTENCE_1436": "Whoa! That was amazing!",
    "SENTENCE_1437": "What a scorching hot attack.",
    "SENTENCE_1438": "Wow! This looks awfully one-sided!",
    "SENTENCE_1439": "Such wonderful moves!",
    "SENTENCE_1440": "Hooray!",
    "SENTENCE_1441": "That did some significant damage.",
    "SENTENCE_1442": "Seems rather effective.",
    "SENTENCE_1443": "Oooh, what's that? Is it some kind of power-up?",
    "SENTENCE_1444": "Boosting your abilities, eh? An excellent decision.",
    "SENTENCE_1445": "They're dodging attacks with incredible speed!",
    "SENTENCE_1446": "Ahaha... It was smart to evade that.",
    "SENTENCE_1447": "Wow! That was surprising!",
    "SENTENCE_1448": "Ah, that settles it.",
    "SENTENCE_1449": "Ah! So cool!",
    "SENTENCE_1450": "It's refreshing to see warriors go all out.",
    "SENTENCE_1451": "That was awesome! You're so cool!",
    "SENTENCE_1452": "A true special attack is something worth seeing.",
    "SENTENCE_1453": "You're amazing! What kind of technique did you just use there?",
    "SENTENCE_1454": "Oops... Is everything okay?",
    "SENTENCE_1455": "Willingly sacrificing your own body...",
    "SENTENCE_1456": "You can transform? That's so cool!",
    "SENTENCE_1457": "Let's see what new heights you reach after you've transformed.",
    "SENTENCE_1458": "I wonder how transforming will affect your strength.",
    "SENTENCE_1459": "You guys can fuse?! You're amazing!",
    "SENTENCE_1460": "The rules do not disallow use of Potara earrings.",
    "SENTENCE_1461": "According to the rules, you are allowed to use Fusion.",
    "SENTENCE_1462": "That was a really big one!",
    "SENTENCE_1463": "That was quite the attack.",
    "SENTENCE_1464": "Ouch, that must have hurt!",
    "SENTENCE_1465": "Oh dear. You couldn't dodge that one.",
    "SENTENCE_1466": "Wow, what incredible speed!",
    "SENTENCE_1467": "I'm sure that wasn't easy to dodge.",
    "SENTENCE_1468": "Good job! You made it through!",
    "SENTENCE_1469": "What a shame. Missed it by that much.",
    "SENTENCE_1470": "Wow! Can you show me that move again?",
    "SENTENCE_1471": "You didn't quite have enough power in that.",
    "SENTENCE_1472": "That was super awesome! More, more!",
    "SENTENCE_1473": "You're certainly not making this boring.",
    "SENTENCE_1474": "Huh? You guys are switching out?",
    "SENTENCE_1475": "Trading out? An intriguing strategy.",
    "SENTENCE_1476": "Hmm. Was your opponent not worthy of you?",
    "SENTENCE_1477": "It's so close, I can't tell who's gonna win in the end!",
    "SENTENCE_1478": "Putting up quite a fight, eh?",
    "SENTENCE_1479": "Wow! This should be one easy victory!",
    "SENTENCE_1480": "The difference in your power levels is vast.",
    "SENTENCE_1481": "Whoa! So fast!",
    "SENTENCE_1482": "Amazing! You went \"poof\" right in front of me!",
    "SENTENCE_1483": "Heh. I nearly lost sight of them.",
    "SENTENCE_1484": "That's it! Finish them off!",
    "SENTENCE_1485": "Interesting. That technique...",
    "SENTENCE_1486": "This is so exciting! Anything could happen!",
    "SENTENCE_1487": "Preparing for a special move, are you?",
    "SENTENCE_1488": "Oh wow!",
    "SENTENCE_1489": "Not a scratch to be seen. What an unexpected surprise!",
    "SENTENCE_1490": "Wow! Looking pretty strong!",
    "SENTENCE_1491": "Seems like someone wants this over with.",
    "SENTENCE_1492": "Hm. Looks like somebody's been holding back.",
    "SENTENCE_1493": "Wait a sec... Where'd they go?",
    "SENTENCE_1494": "Hiding can be an effective strategy, I suppose.",
    "SENTENCE_1495": "Hide and seek's over!",
    "SENTENCE_1496": "There's no getting away from you, is there?",
    "SENTENCE_1497": "Huh?!",
    "SENTENCE_1498": "A shame that didn't end the fight.",
    "SENTENCE_1499": "Look, look! Torn clothing!",
    "SENTENCE_1500": "Oh my. Perhaps I can... recommend a nurse.",
    "SENTENCE_1501": "Whoopsies! Looks like the arena got destroyed!",
    "SENTENCE_1502": "Surely they're reshaping the arena for a reason?",
    "SENTENCE_1503": "Uh-oh! That looked painful.",
    "SENTENCE_1504": "What an incredibly powerful blow!",
    "SENTENCE_1505": "Whoa, was that a double K.O.?",
    "SENTENCE_1506": "Hmm. Seems the both of you can keep on fighting.",
    "SENTENCE_1507": "Go! Go! Keep it up!",
    "SENTENCE_1508": "You're not letting your opponent get a hit in.",
    "SENTENCE_1509": "You're not finished yet, are you?",
    "SENTENCE_1510": "Jumping right back into it, I see.",
    "SENTENCE_1511": "Wow! That was a big hit back!",
    "SENTENCE_1512": "Wonderful. You're reading your opponent perfectly.",
    "SENTENCE_1513": "That's not having any kind of effect!",
    "SENTENCE_1514": "You countered that nicely.",
    "SENTENCE_1515": "Wow! Just barely dodged that one!",
    "SENTENCE_1516": "Humph. Don't expect those attacks to find their mark.",
    "SENTENCE_1517": "Oh. You dodged that one!",
    "SENTENCE_1518": "Keep going! Don't let them get away!",
    "SENTENCE_1519": "Your attack flowed like water. What a beautiful move!",
    "SENTENCE_1520": "Uh-oh. That didn't work.",
    "SENTENCE_1521": "It won't be that easy.",
    "SENTENCE_1522": "And that's it! The match is over!",
    "SENTENCE_1523": "That settles it! We have a winner!",
    "SENTENCE_1524": "All right, that's enough! Geez, talk about overkill...",
    "SENTENCE_1525": "I've seen enough... That wasn't the best matchup, was it?",
    "SENTENCE_1526": "Game, set, and match! What an ending, folks!",
    "SENTENCE_1527": "And look at you go! Heh. You're quite the challenger to\r\nmake it seem so easy.",
    "SENTENCE_1528": "Bum bum ba dum, bwaaah... Out of bounds!",
    "SENTENCE_1529": "A fighter has fallen out of the ring! That's the end of this match!",
    "SENTENCE_1530": "Hmm... What an intense back and forth. Not even I know\r\nhow this'll pan out.",
    "SENTENCE_1531": "Both sides are givin' it their all!",
    "SENTENCE_1532": "Both fighters need to be careful of the time limit!",
    "SENTENCE_1533": "What are you waiting for?! Finish it already!",
    "SENTENCE_1534": "All right, time's up! That's the end of the match!",
    "SENTENCE_1535": "Meh... so much for picking a clear winner.",
    "SENTENCE_1536": "That's a knockout! We have ourselves a winner!",
    "SENTENCE_1537": "Hey, knock it off! They're already down!",
    "SENTENCE_1538": "Hmm, can they make a comeback?",
    "SENTENCE_1539": "Okie dokie, next fighter, please!",
    "SENTENCE_1540": "Going for first blood, huh? That's a smart move.",
    "SENTENCE_1541": "Oh my! They got knocked out pretty quick.",
    "SENTENCE_1542": "Oooh! That was a good one, hehe!",
    "SENTENCE_1543": "Looks like someone's raring to go, huh?",
    "SENTENCE_1544": "What spectacular form!",
    "SENTENCE_1545": "This is the definition of a one-sided fight.",
    "SENTENCE_1546": "Ooooh, that had to hurt!",
    "SENTENCE_1547": "They took that one right on the chin!",
    "SENTENCE_1548": "Oooh, well done!",
    "SENTENCE_1549": "I see we're kicking things up a notch!",
    "SENTENCE_1550": "Hm, will this turn things around?",
    "SENTENCE_1551": "I sure hope they can dodge that...",
    "SENTENCE_1552": "You'd better not take your eyes off the opponent!",
    "SENTENCE_1553": "Wow, that was a surprise!",
    "SENTENCE_1554": "Hey! Say something before you just jump in!",
    "SENTENCE_1555": "Whoa! Lookin' good out there!",
    "SENTENCE_1556": "Yep, that's what I expected!",
    "SENTENCE_1557": "Looks like someone's all fired up! Nyehehe! Snrk!",
    "SENTENCE_1558": "Hey, let's not take things too far, now!",
    "SENTENCE_1559": "Whoa, what was that?!",
    "SENTENCE_1560": "Yikes! Everyone get down!",
    "SENTENCE_1561": "Relax! Take some deep breaths, okay?",
    "SENTENCE_1562": "All righty! Feel free to go nuts!",
    "SENTENCE_1563": "Oooh! Things are starting to get interesting! Hehe!",
    "SENTENCE_1564": "Bwahahaha! What's with that pose?! Ahem, my apologies...",
    "SENTENCE_1565": "Hmm, I wonder how much stronger they'll become after fusing.",
    "SENTENCE_1566": "Whoa there! Are you okay?",
    "SENTENCE_1567": "Ah, I see. You're trying for a ring out.",
    "SENTENCE_1568": "Hey, don't knock them towards me!",
    "SENTENCE_1569": "Careful! At this rate, you're gonna get knocked out of the ring!",
    "SENTENCE_1570": "Great one! Well done out there!",
    "SENTENCE_1571": "Wow... That was impressive.",
    "SENTENCE_1572": "Hey! There's no need to get upset.",
    "SENTENCE_1573": "You wouldn't expect that kind of strength from a dead man walking...",
    "SENTENCE_1574": "Phew! For a second, I thought they were headed my way...",
    "SENTENCE_1575": "That's it! Good work!",
    "SENTENCE_1576": "Whew! I was on the edge of my seat!",
    "SENTENCE_1577": "Hmm, those guys really are an incredible bunch.",
    "SENTENCE_1578": "Everything in moderation...",
    "SENTENCE_1579": "You're rarin' to go, aren't ya?",
    "SENTENCE_1580": "It's fair to switch out fighters if you need to.",
    "SENTENCE_1581": "Wow, what a match!",
    "SENTENCE_1582": "Hmm... At this point, it's hard to tell who's got the\r\nadvantage here.",
    "SENTENCE_1583": "Remember, you can surrender if this match gets to be\r\ntoo much for ya!",
    "SENTENCE_1584": "Try not to be too rash out there...",
    "SENTENCE_1585": "They're gone...",
    "SENTENCE_1586": "So fast!",
    "SENTENCE_1587": "What exactly do you have up your sleeve?",
    "SENTENCE_1588": "Hmm, looks like the tables might be turning.",
    "SENTENCE_1589": "What was that?",
    "SENTENCE_1590": "What in the world are you planning?",
    "SENTENCE_1591": "Huh? You don't have a scratch on you!",
    "SENTENCE_1592": "A decisive victory. How extraordinary...",
    "SENTENCE_1593": "Why aren't you going all out from the get-go?!",
    "SENTENCE_1594": "That's it! Keep it up!",
    "SENTENCE_1595": "Who knew you had so much power up your sleeve...",
    "SENTENCE_1596": "Hey! Where'd you go?",
    "SENTENCE_1597": "Quit running, already!",
    "SENTENCE_1598": "Oh, there you are!",
    "SENTENCE_1599": "I won't lose sight of you again!",
    "SENTENCE_1600": "Hahahaha! That was an excellent block!",
    "SENTENCE_1601": "Bring it on! I'm not goin' down without puttin' up a fight!",
    "SENTENCE_1602": "Oh man, you look like a total mess...",
    "SENTENCE_1603": "Looks like they got you pretty good, didn't they?",
    "SENTENCE_1604": "Don't destroy the arena!",
    "SENTENCE_1605": "I wonder if it's time I got going now...",
    "SENTENCE_1606": "This is your chance!",
    "SENTENCE_1607": "Come on, get up already!",
    "SENTENCE_1608": "What's wrong with you?! Fight back!",
    "SENTENCE_1609": "Hmm, you're putting up quite a good fight.",
    "SENTENCE_1610": "Good! It's your turn to attack!",
    "SENTENCE_1611": "Keep up the aggression!",
    "SENTENCE_1612": "Whew! That was too close... for comfort.",
    "SENTENCE_1613": "Show me how strong your will is!",
    "SENTENCE_1614": "You're not just taking it laying down, I see.",
    "SENTENCE_1615": "Nice try, but I saw that!",
    "SENTENCE_1616": "That didn't even leave a scratch!",
    "SENTENCE_1617": "Good! You're managing to keep up with me!",
    "SENTENCE_1618": "Nope, that won't do!",
    "SENTENCE_1619": "I can't believe you dodged that!",
    "SENTENCE_1620": "Too bad! I can see right through you.",
    "SENTENCE_1621": "Whoa! I'd rather not get hit by that, thanks.",
    "SENTENCE_1622": "Oh ho!",
    "SENTENCE_1623": "Nice dodge there.",
    "SENTENCE_1624": "Didn't think you'd win that!",
    "SENTENCE_1625": "Good! Excellently done!",
    "SENTENCE_1627": "You demonstrated your superiority. Good work out there.",
    "SENTENCE_1628": "Better than I expected! That was well fought!",
    "SENTENCE_1629": "Huh. I suppose you have some skill.",
    "SENTENCE_1630": "You certainly know how to put on a show. Not bad.",
    "SENTENCE_1631": "Fool! Watch the ring's boundaries!",
    "SENTENCE_1632": "That's out of bounds, isn't it? We have a winner!",
    "SENTENCE_1633": "Hmm... I wonder how this'll turn out.",
    "SENTENCE_1634": "Whatever you do, don't bore me!",
    "SENTENCE_1635": "Quit messing around and finish it!",
    "SENTENCE_1636": "What are you doing?! There's no time to mess around!",
    "SENTENCE_1637": "Humph! Seems they couldn't scrape out a win.",
    "SENTENCE_1638": "Time's up! The judges will decide this one!",
    "SENTENCE_1639": "Damn it! That's not good!",
    "SENTENCE_1640": "Oh my... That's not very good.",
    "SENTENCE_1641": "If someone on your team takes a hit, just hit 'em back\r\ntwice as hard!",
    "SENTENCE_1642": "You there! It's up to you to settle this!",
    "SENTENCE_1643": "Good! Keep attacking!",
    "SENTENCE_1644": "Finish it quickly!",
    "SENTENCE_1645": "Good, good!",
    "SENTENCE_1646": "That's how you do it!",
    "SENTENCE_1647": "Hehehe! They can't even touch you!",
    "SENTENCE_1648": "Keep your momentum going!",
    "SENTENCE_1649": "That's it!",
    "SENTENCE_1650": "Oooh! Nice one!",
    "SENTENCE_1651": "Impressive technique!",
    "SENTENCE_1652": "Now the real fight begins...",
    "SENTENCE_1653": "I see... You still have some power hidden away you\r\nhaven't shown yet!",
    "SENTENCE_1654": "Focus! Don't let them hit you again!",
    "SENTENCE_1655": "Do it! Crush them!",
    "SENTENCE_1656": "Hahahaha! Direct hit!",
    "SENTENCE_1658": "Destroy them!",
    "SENTENCE_1659": "Smash 'em into the dirt!",
    "SENTENCE_1660": "Give them a reason to remember your name!",
    "SENTENCE_1661": "Do it! Now's your chance!",
    "SENTENCE_1662": "Destroy everyone and everything!",
    "SENTENCE_1663": "Will this move end it all?!",
    "SENTENCE_1664": "The idea is not to get hit!",
    "SENTENCE_1665": "I get it! Losing the battle to win the war!",
    "SENTENCE_1666": "Oh, a transformation. How original.",
    "SENTENCE_1667": "Oh? A power-up, eh?",
    "SENTENCE_1668": "Transforming's useless if you don't know how to use it.",
    "SENTENCE_1669": "All right! I don't care how you pull it off! Just win!",
    "SENTENCE_1670": "Use whatever to win! Even a Potara if you have to!",
    "SENTENCE_1671": "You absolutely must not fail.",
    "SENTENCE_1672": "Push them out of the ring!",
    "SENTENCE_1673": "All right! A direct hit!",
    "SENTENCE_1674": "Back on your feet and try again!",
    "SENTENCE_1675": "Be careful not to go out of bounds!",
    "SENTENCE_1676": "Oh... What were you thinking?!",
    "SENTENCE_1677": "Whoa, whoa, what's going on here?",
    "SENTENCE_1678": "So close to victory...",
    "SENTENCE_1679": "Losing like that is kinda pathetic, don'tcha think?",
    "SENTENCE_1680": "Yes! You beat 'em!",
    "SENTENCE_1681": "Nicely done! Keep 'em boxed in!",
    "SENTENCE_1682": "Come on, hang in there!",
    "SENTENCE_1683": "What a beautiful finish!",
    "SENTENCE_1684": "Doesn't matter who you face. Blow them away!",
    "SENTENCE_1685": "Don't stop hitting them 'til they go down!",
    "SENTENCE_1686": "You've gotta know when it's time to retreat.",
    "SENTENCE_1687": "Drop your guard for even a second and you're a goner!",
    "SENTENCE_1688": "Eh... Someone's putting up a fight.",
    "SENTENCE_1689": "Well... That's quite the difference in skill levels.",
    "SENTENCE_1690": "And that settles it!",
    "SENTENCE_1691": "All that darting about...",
    "SENTENCE_1692": "Nicely done! Circle up!",
    "SENTENCE_1693": "Pretty quick.",
    "SENTENCE_1694": "Keep them pinned down!",
    "SENTENCE_1695": "Don't let up!",
    "SENTENCE_1696": "It seems they have a plan...",
    "SENTENCE_1697": "Something's coming...",
    "SENTENCE_1698": "Hahaha! That was incredible!",
    "SENTENCE_1699": "That's the way! Don't hold anything back!",
    "SENTENCE_1700": "Finish the fight in one go!",
    "SENTENCE_1701": "All right, here we go!",
    "SENTENCE_1702": "Only a coward would hide.",
    "SENTENCE_1703": "Huh? Where'd they go?",
    "SENTENCE_1704": "Over there!",
    "SENTENCE_1705": "There they are!",
    "SENTENCE_1706": "Hahaha! Those defenses aren't bad!",
    "SENTENCE_1708": "That was a pathetic showing.",
    "SENTENCE_1709": "Whoa, someone's in bad shape...",
    "SENTENCE_1710": "Excellent... Crush them to bits!",
    "SENTENCE_1711": "Crush 'em 'til not even atoms remain!",
    "SENTENCE_1712": "Oh crap! I blew it!",
    "SENTENCE_1713": "Ugh. A tie.",
    "SENTENCE_1714": "Damn. Evenly matched.",
    "SENTENCE_1715": "Finish them off!",
    "SENTENCE_1716": "Don't let them escape!",
    "SENTENCE_1717": "Nice recovery!",
    "SENTENCE_1718": "You're pretty tough, huh?",
    "SENTENCE_1719": "Hehe! That was pretty good!",
    "SENTENCE_1720": "Nice one!",
    "SENTENCE_1721": "Nicely done! You've got a handle on this!",
    "SENTENCE_1722": "That pathetic attack won't work!",
    "SENTENCE_1723": "That's it! Good!",
    "SENTENCE_1724": "Nice moves!",
    "SENTENCE_1725": "Whoo! Dodged it!",
    "SENTENCE_1726": "Guess you saw that coming!",
    "SENTENCE_1727": "Yeah! Smash them apart!",
    "SENTENCE_1728": "Good. Keep it up.",
    "SENTENCE_1730": "Game over!",
    "SENTENCE_1731": "That's it! Match over!",
    "SENTENCE_1732": "I-It's over! We're good!",
    "SENTENCE_1733": "Aw man! I blinked and it's already over?",
    "SENTENCE_1734": "Aw, damn! That match totally ruled!",
    "SENTENCE_1735": "Whoa, nice one! That's the match!",
    "SENTENCE_1736": "Out of bounds! Game over!",
    "SENTENCE_1737": "Oh! That was out of bounds. It's over!",
    "SENTENCE_1738": "Hehehehe! This is gonna be a fight for the history books!",
    "SENTENCE_1739": "Hmm, you're puttin' up a decent fight.",
    "SENTENCE_1740": "Hey, don't forget there's a time limit!",
    "SENTENCE_1741": "Yo, what do we say we finish this?",
    "SENTENCE_1742": "That's it! Time's up!",
    "SENTENCE_1743": "Time's up! The match is over!",
    "SENTENCE_1744": "Yeowch, that's gonna sting!",
    "SENTENCE_1745": "Oh boy, I know your pain, dude!",
    "SENTENCE_1746": "Payback time!",
    "SENTENCE_1747": "You can still win this one! Keep it up!",
    "SENTENCE_1748": "Straight down to business!",
    "SENTENCE_1749": "The fight is off to a violent start!",
    "SENTENCE_1750": "Nice moves! You've been training, haven't you?",
    "SENTENCE_1751": "Go, go! Keep attacking!",
    "SENTENCE_1752": "The hits just keep comin'! Break their streak if you can!",
    "SENTENCE_1753": "That's good! You're doin' awesome!",
    "SENTENCE_1754": "Wow! What a fight!",
    "SENTENCE_1755": "Whoa! I felt that one!",
    "SENTENCE_1756": "Ugh! That hurt to watch!",
    "SENTENCE_1757": "Let's see what you've got.",
    "SENTENCE_1758": "Huh? Wait, what's goin' on?",
    "SENTENCE_1759": "So fast!",
    "SENTENCE_1760": "Whoa! What a dodge!",
    "SENTENCE_1761": "What was that?!",
    "SENTENCE_1762": "I didn't expect that!",
    "SENTENCE_1763": "Has that decided it?!",
    "SENTENCE_1764": "Great! Now hammer it home!",
    "SENTENCE_1765": "Whoa! Is this the finale?",
    "SENTENCE_1766": "Wow, that attack was nuts!",
    "SENTENCE_1767": "Huh? What just happened?!",
    "SENTENCE_1768": "Hahahaha! Wow!",
    "SENTENCE_1769": "Geez, well that was kind of a waste...",
    "SENTENCE_1770": "You're really putting all you've got into those attacks, huh?",
    "SENTENCE_1771": "Oh! How's this gonna go?",
    "SENTENCE_1772": "Whoa! A transformation!",
    "SENTENCE_1773": "Wonder how this'll change the flow of the battle...",
    "SENTENCE_1774": "Hahaha! Those poses aren't getting any cooler!",
    "SENTENCE_1775": "Whoa! Looks like a big power up!",
    "SENTENCE_1776": "Direct hit!",
    "SENTENCE_1777": "That one hurt 'em!",
    "SENTENCE_1778": "Hey! Don't think this'll be over so quick!",
    "SENTENCE_1779": "Whoa, totally blown away!",
    "SENTENCE_1780": "So fast... My eyes can barely keep up.",
    "SENTENCE_1781": "Th-This is fine! I should be able to catch up!",
    "SENTENCE_1782": "Aw man! So close.",
    "SENTENCE_1783": "That's some power! A guy could lose his nerve...",
    "SENTENCE_1784": "Yeah! Pushed 'em back!",
    "SENTENCE_1785": "Geez... Shot me down.",
    "SENTENCE_1786": "Eh, I don't know about this, to be totally honest...",
    "SENTENCE_1787": "Yeesh! You're super into this...",
    "SENTENCE_1788": "Oh, you taggin' out?",
    "SENTENCE_1789": "Switchin' out? Yeah, nice call!",
    "SENTENCE_1790": "You can fall back for now.",
    "SENTENCE_1791": "This fight's so epic! I can't look away!",
    "SENTENCE_1792": "Oh man! Which side's gonna win?!",
    "SENTENCE_1793": "Hey, don't push yourself too hard!",
    "SENTENCE_1794": "The difference in strength's a little too much...",
    "SENTENCE_1795": "Huh? Where'd you go?",
    "SENTENCE_1796": "They disappeared!",
    "SENTENCE_1797": "They're too fast for me to follow!",
    "SENTENCE_1798": "Whoa! My eyes can barely keep up.",
    "SENTENCE_1799": "Whoa! Nice one!",
    "SENTENCE_1800": "What the hell?!",
    "SENTENCE_1801": "Here comes a big one!",
    "SENTENCE_1802": "Wait, you mean I gotta fight 'em if they win?!",
    "SENTENCE_1803": "A total victory... I've got nothing to say.",
    "SENTENCE_1804": "Still hiding some power, are ya?",
    "SENTENCE_1805": "You're about to get serious, huh?",
    "SENTENCE_1806": "Huh! You're pretty good!",
    "SENTENCE_1807": "Whoops! I must've lost 'em.",
    "SENTENCE_1808": "Huh? Where'd you go?",
    "SENTENCE_1809": "Ah, there you are!",
    "SENTENCE_1810": "Hey, get back over here!",
    "SENTENCE_1811": "Whew, should've figured it wouldn't be easy...",
    "SENTENCE_1812": "All right! You've got some solid defense!",
    "SENTENCE_1813": "Nice goin'! You went and ruined my favorite clothes!",
    "SENTENCE_1814": "Maybe I'm not as durable as I thought...",
    "SENTENCE_1815": "Be careful with that! You might actually hurt someone. Like me!",
    "SENTENCE_1816": "Come on! Don't destroy the arena!",
    "SENTENCE_1817": "I really beefed that one...",
    "SENTENCE_1818": "Y-You okay, dude?",
    "SENTENCE_1819": "Whoa, whoa, whoa! What just happened?",
    "SENTENCE_1820": "Wait a sec... It's a draw?",
    "SENTENCE_1821": "Perfect! Now's my chance!",
    "SENTENCE_1822": "You're not gettin' away!",
    "SENTENCE_1823": "Good! Nice recovery!",
    "SENTENCE_1824": "Whew, that was a close one!",
    "SENTENCE_1825": "Whoa! Okay, okay!",
    "SENTENCE_1826": "Damn! You got me good!",
    "SENTENCE_1827": "Dude!",
    "SENTENCE_1828": "That won't even leave a mark!",
    "SENTENCE_1829": "You've got some quick moves!",
    "SENTENCE_1830": "No dodgin' that!",
    "SENTENCE_1831": "So close! But no cigar.",
    "SENTENCE_1832": "There you are! This is it!",
    "SENTENCE_1833": "I'm gonna blow you away!",
    "SENTENCE_1834": "Agh, so close...",
    "SENTENCE_1835": "All right! Smooth moves!",
    "SENTENCE_1836": "Deryaryaryaaa!",
    "SENTENCE_1837": "Dadadadah!",
    "SENTENCE_1838": "Hah!",
    "SENTENCE_1839": "Fuh...",
    "SENTENCE_1840": "HAAH!",
    "SENTENCE_1841": "Daaaah!",
    "SENTENCE_1842": "Guh!",
    "SENTENCE_1843": "Daaah!",
    "SENTENCE_1844": "Hah!",

    "SENTENCE_1848": "Uryaah!",
    "SENTENCE_1849": "Hyah!",
    "SENTENCE_1850": "Draaah!",
    "SENTENCE_1851": "Close one!",
    "SENTENCE_1852": "Gotta watch it!",
    "SENTENCE_1853": "Humph!",
    "SENTENCE_1854": "HAAAAAH!",
    "SENTENCE_1855": "Heh.",
    "SENTENCE_1856": "DAAH!",
    "SENTENCE_1857": "Then hurry up and get serious.",
    "SENTENCE_1858": "You're on!",
    "SENTENCE_1859": "Ngh... Not bad.",
    "SENTENCE_1860": "That's what I'm talking about!",
    "SENTENCE_1861": "Come at me with everything you've got!",
    "SENTENCE_1862": "All right, you asked for it!",
    "SENTENCE_1863": "Out of range, eh? What now?",
    "SENTENCE_1864": "How d'ya like that?!",
    "SENTENCE_1865": "You won't win just by flailing around!",
    "SENTENCE_1866": "Yeah, I know. I just like to change it up now and then, that's all!",
    "SENTENCE_1867": "What's wrong? Scared you'll lose?",
    "SENTENCE_1868": "You won't lay a finger on me from over there!",
    "SENTENCE_1869": "You won't block this one!",
    "SENTENCE_1870": "Gotcha!",
    "SENTENCE_1871": "You're in for it now!",
    "SENTENCE_1872": "That's how it is... No other choice!",
    "SENTENCE_1873": "No more holding back!",
    "SENTENCE_1874": "If that's what you want... Here it is!",
    "SENTENCE_1875": "Come on! I've seen you fight harder than this!",
    "SENTENCE_1876": "I'm not holding anything back!",
    "SENTENCE_1877": "You two have no sense of restraint, do you?",
    "SENTENCE_1878": "And... here we are!",
    "SENTENCE_1879": "Why are you like this?!",
    "SENTENCE_1880": "Ehehe! Sorry!",
    "SENTENCE_1881": "All right. Let's go!",
    "SENTENCE_1882": "Come back soon, okay?",
    "SENTENCE_1883": "Okay, see you 'round!",
    "SENTENCE_1884": "Wow! Everybody's here!",
    "SENTENCE_1885": "Yo!",
    "SENTENCE_1886": "Sup?",
    "SENTENCE_1887": "All right. I believe we should keep moving.",

    "SENTENCE_1896": "Let's give this a shot!",
    "SENTENCE_1897": "What kind of training should I do next?",
    "SENTENCE_1898": "Ugh, so noisy around here.",
    "SENTENCE_1899": "Suppose it's back to the grindstone...",
    "SENTENCE_1900": "So, what can that thing do, anyway?",
    "SENTENCE_1901": "Hehehe... I'll show you, just wait!",
    "SENTENCE_1902": "Hey, at least your husband works at all!",
    "SENTENCE_1903": "It's somewhere out in space! All that stuff is beyond me...",

    "SENTENCE_2013": "Don't you dare go easy on me, okay?",
    "SENTENCE_2014": "Who'd have thought such a simple plan would work...",
    "SENTENCE_2015": "Haa ha ha ha ha!",
    "SENTENCE_2016": "Aren't you acting a bit out of character?",
    "SENTENCE_2017": "That's what you get for wearing those clothes.",

    "SENTENCE_2019": "I didn't expect that from you.",
    "SENTENCE_2020": "Ungh... My eyes hurt.",

    "SENTENCE_2051": "What are you doing?!",
    "SENTENCE_2052": "Hehehe... So the time has come.",
    "SENTENCE_2053": "Huh? Who are you?",
    "SENTENCE_2054": "You're not going to get your way today!",

    "SENTENCE_2057": "What incredible determination...",
    "SENTENCE_2059": "Hurry up and crush them!",
    "SENTENCE_2073": "Shall we display the fruits of our training, then?",
    "SENTENCE_2074": "That's right...!",
    "SENTENCE_2075": "Man, I'm just not what I used to be.",
    "SENTENCE_2076": "Do you think a new strategy will beat me?",
    "SENTENCE_2077": "Overcoming weaknesses is never easy.\r\nYou've done well to come this far.",
    "SENTENCE_2078": "I suppose that's true.",
    "SENTENCE_2079": "That was awesome! Let's play fight!",
    "SENTENCE_2080": "That sounds fun. Let's give it a try!",
    "SENTENCE_2081": "Ungh... You're both pretty strong...",
    "SENTENCE_2082": "What the...? Wow, you're sloppy!",
    "SENTENCE_2083": "Humph... Okay, we'll fight as Gotenks next!",
    "SENTENCE_2084": "Great! Bring it on!",
    "SENTENCE_2085": "Hmm... I think I'm forgetting something.",
    "SENTENCE_2086": "Damn it!",
    "SENTENCE_2087": "Hmm... I think I'm forgetting something important...",
    "SENTENCE_2088": "Hm? What's up?",
    "SENTENCE_2089": "Oh...!",
    "SENTENCE_2090": "No one's come back, yet...",
    "SENTENCE_2091": "Just killing is becoming a bore. \r\nLet's pretend we're cars and run each other over.",
    "SENTENCE_2092": "Humph... Fascinating... However, I won't lose anymore.",
    "SENTENCE_2093": "Bastards!",
    "SENTENCE_2094": "I'm impressed you escaped in one piece after the beating you took...",
    "SENTENCE_2095": "This time, you're the ones who're gonna suffer!",
    "SENTENCE_2096": "Ngh...!",
    "SENTENCE_2097": "Sorry to disappoint you...",
    "SENTENCE_2098": "The last time we fought, I barely even used half of my true power.",

    "SENTENCE_2100": "*pant* *pant* I won!",
    "SENTENCE_2101": "Aren't you supposed to be dead?",
    "SENTENCE_2102": "I'm a bit embarrassed, but...",
    "SENTENCE_2103": "The truth is, I used to steal when I was a kid...",
    "SENTENCE_2104": "I remembered it just now.",
    "SENTENCE_2105": "I see...",
    "SENTENCE_2106": "END",

    "SENTENCE_2122": "Thank you for playing!",
    "SENTENCE_2123": "THANK YOU FOR PLAYING!",
    "SENTENCE_2124": "What for?",
    "SENTENCE_2125": "A lot has happened since then.",
    "SENTENCE_2126": "I want to see how strong I've become.",
    "SENTENCE_2127": "Humph, don't blame me for what happens!",
    "SENTENCE_2128": "Don't worry! It'll be fine!",
    "SENTENCE_2129": "Why do I have to...?",
    "SENTENCE_2130": "I'm not gonna die just yet...",

    "SENTENCE_2179": "They might just be someone I can talk to...",
    "SENTENCE_2180": "Just all talk...",
    "SENTENCE_2181": "This is what happens when you go around making stupid promises!",
    "SENTENCE_2182": "Well then, wanna give it a go?",
    "SENTENCE_2183": "Wait a second!",
    "SENTENCE_2184": "Pathetic! You were all talk!",
    "SENTENCE_2185": "Please fight me again one day.",

    "SENTENCE_2187": "Guh...",
    "SENTENCE_2188": "I just couldn't keep up...",
    "SENTENCE_2189": "You've done well just to remain on your feet.",

    "SENTENCE_2216": "Hehe. Hate to tell ya, but you probably should have finished me off while\r\nyou still had the chance.",

    "SENTENCE_2246": "You don't seem like a bad guy. At least not to me.",
    "SENTENCE_2247": "Do human lives really mean so little to you?!",
    "SENTENCE_2248": "This is awesome! Just the kind of excitement I was lookin' for!",
    "SENTENCE_2249": "I'm gonna do it! I'm going to put it all into this next attack!",
    "SENTENCE_2250": "Ngh! Oh no... Is this the limit of Super Saiyan God?",
    "SENTENCE_2251": "I was kinda hopin' for a little more excitement than this!",
    "SENTENCE_2252": "Haha! You're pretty damn impressive!",
    "SENTENCE_2253": "Hehe! I'm not about to die just yet! Not until I beat\r\nyou, at least!",
    "SENTENCE_2254": "That's all you've got? Try a little harder. I'm not\r\neven Super Saiyan yet!",
    "SENTENCE_2255": "Been a while since I fought someone as strong as you!\r\nThis'll be a real tough one!",
    "SENTENCE_2256": "I'm not gonna let you keep doing whatever you want!",
    "SENTENCE_2257": "You got guts, dontcha?",
    "SENTENCE_2258": "Hey! I'm over here! Hello! Any day now!",
    "SENTENCE_2259": "Too bad. I bet you underestimated me 'cause of my size, didn't you?",
    "SENTENCE_2260": "No need to hold back! I've still got plenty of fight in me!",
    "SENTENCE_2261": "I'm just getting started, trust me! The real fight starts now!",
    "SENTENCE_2262": "Man, it's been a long time since I got this excited!",
    "SENTENCE_2263": "I need to end this one quick, or I'm going to change back!",
    "SENTENCE_2264": "A fight between men, huh? If that's what's goin' on,\r\nlet's keep fighting until one of us taps out!",
    "SENTENCE_2265": "Hehe! Super Saiyan 3 is totally freakin' awesome, even\r\nwhen I'm a kid! Don'tcha think?",
    "SENTENCE_2266": "My grandpa told me all about girls. He said if I ever\r\nmet one I should be as pleasant as possible.",
    "SENTENCE_2267": "I'm gonna put everything I've got into this one punch!",
    "SENTENCE_2268": "I-I know what you are! You've gotta be a witch or\r\nsomethin'! You're not gonna scare me!",
    "SENTENCE_2269": "You're about to get smashed by my Power Pole! Hyah!",
    "SENTENCE_2270": "What's that?",
    "SENTENCE_2271": "Here I come!",
    "SENTENCE_2272": "I'm Goku! Nice to meetcha!",
    "SENTENCE_2273": "You won't beat me! I've trained so hard, my skin is as\r\ntough as steel!",
    "SENTENCE_2274": "Ah... I'm so hungry... I can't even lift a finger...",
    "SENTENCE_2275": "You're super strong! Just the way I like it!",
    "SENTENCE_2276": "Of all the places on your planet, you choose this as your gravesite...",
    "SENTENCE_2277": "I, Vegeta, Prince of all Saiyans, will rule the universe!",
    "SENTENCE_2278": "This is preposterous!",
    "SENTENCE_2279": "I doubt you'll be so smug once you realize what you're up against.",
    "SENTENCE_2280": "You must die...by a Saiyan's hands...",
    "SENTENCE_2281": "Are you finally catching on? Your backwater planet is doomed!",
    "SENTENCE_2282": "Whoever gets in my way, I destroy.",
    "SENTENCE_2283": "In this state, I'm apt to get what you might call a bit overzealous...",
    "SENTENCE_2284": "If I let myself go, the whole Earth would be destroyed.",
    "SENTENCE_2285": "You're pissing me off so much I'm getting a headache!",
    "SENTENCE_2286": "Ngh! How can you be as strong as I?!",
    "SENTENCE_2287": "Just goes to show you what peace and quiet does for the undisciplined.",
    "SENTENCE_2288": "This is what it means to be a true Saiyan!",
    "SENTENCE_2289": "Sorry, but I'm not the sit-around-and-do-nothing type.",
    "SENTENCE_2290": "Die!",
    "SENTENCE_2291": "Th-These attacks are something else!",
    "SENTENCE_2292": "Well, looks as though this just turned into the worst-case scenario.",
    "SENTENCE_2293": "What is this? Some sort of Super Saiyan bargain sale?",
    "SENTENCE_2294": "It's the end of the line for you!",
    "SENTENCE_2295": "Despite everything that's happened to them, no one down there believes me!",
    "SENTENCE_2296": "Tch. And after all that, you're smiling...",
    "SENTENCE_2297": "What? Are you out of your mind?!",
    "SENTENCE_2298": "You don't know who you're speaking to! The Prince of all Saiyans!",
    "SENTENCE_2299": "I sold my soul to Babidi to discard my worthless attachments!",
    "SENTENCE_2300": "Whatever's beyond a piece of work, you're it!",
    "SENTENCE_2301": "If we can only win using fusion, then let's do it!",
    "SENTENCE_2302": "Do not underestimate the power of the great Vegeta!",
    "SENTENCE_2303": "Hey! Don't be so intrusive!",
    "SENTENCE_2304": "Stubborn little pissant!",
    "SENTENCE_2305": "This is madness! Am I actually scared?",
    "SENTENCE_2306": "Don't get ahead of yourself. I'm winning this fight!",
    "SENTENCE_2307": "So the proud prince of Saiyans has come to this...",
    "SENTENCE_2308": "Damn it... Damn it all!",
    "SENTENCE_2309": "I don't care! Let's burn this all down!",
    "SENTENCE_2310": "Enough with the boasting! I couldn't care less!",
    "SENTENCE_2311": "Gah! What a pain!",
    "SENTENCE_2312": "Never let your guard down on the battlefield.",
    "SENTENCE_2313": "I am the greatest of all Saiyan warriors!",
    "SENTENCE_2314": "What is this incredible energy?",
    "SENTENCE_2315": "You are an absolute dunce.",
    "SENTENCE_2316": "I don't pay people back tenfold. More like a hundredfold!",
    "SENTENCE_2317": "I am Super Vegeta!",
    "SENTENCE_2318": "This is no time to mess around.",
    "SENTENCE_2319": "This will be enough to take you down.",
    "SENTENCE_2320": "I'll see for myself if you're the real deal.",
    "SENTENCE_2321": "Do you fear of the power of a god?",
    "SENTENCE_2322": "Soon I will be number one!",
    "SENTENCE_2323": "Now that I've become a Great Ape, I'm ten times\r\nstronger than before!",
    "SENTENCE_2324": "What's wrong? Can't even run away now?",
    "SENTENCE_2325": "Heh... Your struggle is over.",
    "SENTENCE_2326": "My mistake. I oughta be more careful where I step. How clumsy!",
    "SENTENCE_2327": "Now I'm going to crush you until there's nothing left!",
    "SENTENCE_2329": "You're hopeless... Utterly hopeless.",
    "SENTENCE_2330": "Stop it!",
    "SENTENCE_2331": "I can't run away... I have to win this!",
    "SENTENCE_2332": "Mom's gonna be mad at me...",
    "SENTENCE_2333": "Man... Talk about intense!",
    "SENTENCE_2335": "I wonder... could I ever surpass my dad?",
    "SENTENCE_2336": "Haha! Thank you!",
    "SENTENCE_2337": "Guess I really have gotten stronger!",
    "SENTENCE_2338": "Wh-What do you think you're doing?!",
    "SENTENCE_2340": "Damn... It's not working!",
    "SENTENCE_2341": "Lookin' good! You're a real natural!",
    "SENTENCE_2342": "I have to end this. Right here.",
    "SENTENCE_2343": "Believe me, I'm a hell of a lot stronger than this!",
    "SENTENCE_2344": "This is not looking good...",
    "SENTENCE_2345": "There's a tremendous energy building up...",
    "SENTENCE_2346": "I bet I'm a whole lot faster than you!",
    "SENTENCE_2347": "If I drop my guard for even a second, I'm toast.",
    "SENTENCE_2348": "I have... to protect... everyone!",
    "SENTENCE_2349": "Give me all you've got.",
    "SENTENCE_2350": "This energy... It can't be!",
    "SENTENCE_2351": "So we gonna do this, or what?",
    "SENTENCE_2352": "Confidence alone won't bring you victory.",
    "SENTENCE_2353": "No cheap tricks! Just come at me!",
    "SENTENCE_2354": "I know I'm already wearing the suit, but... Transformation!",
    "SENTENCE_2355": "Champion of Justice, the Great Saiyaman!",
    "SENTENCE_2356": "No getting away!",
    "SENTENCE_2357": "This intense power I feel inside... Is this really mine?",
    "SENTENCE_2358": "Time to finish you off for good!",
    "SENTENCE_2359": "Color me surprised at how cool-headed you are.",
    "SENTENCE_2360": "Don't get distracted! Your fight's with me now, and only me!",
    "SENTENCE_2361": "Looks like this won't be so easy.",
    "SENTENCE_2362": "You're gonna pay for this...",
    "SENTENCE_2363": "That's enough for today.",
    "SENTENCE_2364": "Good!",
    "SENTENCE_2365": "If only I were as strong as my dad...",
    "SENTENCE_2366": "You're the one who's gonna suffer!",
    "SENTENCE_2367": "I have to protect...the hopes of everyone on Earth!",
    "SENTENCE_2368": "I'm not dying! Not here... Not like this!",
    "SENTENCE_2369": "Watch over me, everyone...",
    "SENTENCE_2370": "I am only a Namekian who has long since forgotten his true name.",
    "SENTENCE_2371": "They're truly in a class of their own!",
    "SENTENCE_2372": "Tch. So you survived...",
    "SENTENCE_2373": "Ha. This is nothing more than a circus, now.",
    "SENTENCE_2374": "Grand Elder Guru is aware of your situation.",
    "SENTENCE_2375": "He may be speaking the truth...",
    "SENTENCE_2376": "I must protect Grand Elder Guru!",
    "SENTENCE_2377": "That's it! I'm gonna get you back for this!",
    "SENTENCE_2378": "Time to show off the results of my training!",
    "SENTENCE_2379": "The name's Yamcha, but you can call me the handsome Desert Bandit!",
    "SENTENCE_2380": "Now, for my... Wolf Fang Pitch!",
    "SENTENCE_2381": "What strength... They're on a completely different level!",
    "SENTENCE_2382": "I'm grateful that I get to do battle with someone like you.",
    "SENTENCE_2383": "Chiaotzu... Your sacrifice will not be in vain.",
    "SENTENCE_2384": "Now it's your turn.",
    "SENTENCE_2385": "What's wrong? That all you got?",
    "SENTENCE_2386": "You're too strong... This... This might be impossible!",
    "SENTENCE_2387": "Now die!",
    "SENTENCE_2388": "Got something you wanna say?",
    "SENTENCE_2389": "Good luck with your training!",
    "SENTENCE_2390": "Huh? He's gone totally berserk!",
    "SENTENCE_2391": "As things are now, I could beat you without breakin' a sweat!",
    "SENTENCE_2392": "My father might be okay with letting you go, but I'm not!",
    "SENTENCE_2393": "This is the end for you.",
    "SENTENCE_2394": "It can't be! How the hell did you get here?!",
    "SENTENCE_2395": "There's no way... This can't be possible!",
    "SENTENCE_2396": "Damn... I guess I'm all out of options.",
    "SENTENCE_2397": "I swear I'll beat you this time!",
    "SENTENCE_2398": "I'm more than ready.",
    "SENTENCE_2399": "Why can't I hit him?!",
    "SENTENCE_2400": "Take a close look... I'm about to show you my true power!",
    "SENTENCE_2401": "Just so you know, I'm not gonna go easy on you.",
    "SENTENCE_2402": "Ugh... Idiot.",
    "SENTENCE_2403": "Hey! What's the big deal! You never said you were gonna hit back!",
    "SENTENCE_2404": "No!",
    "SENTENCE_2405": "Stupid idiot!",
    "SENTENCE_2406": "Whoa... This energy is crazy!",
    "SENTENCE_2407": "All right!",
    "SENTENCE_2408": "Hehehe!",
    "SENTENCE_2409": "Yes, sir!",
    "SENTENCE_2410": "Welp, now I'm bored.",
    "SENTENCE_2411": "Should I try it?",
    "SENTENCE_2412": "Yeah! Let's do this!",
    "SENTENCE_2413": "Uh... Sorry about that!",
    "SENTENCE_2414": "Woohoo!",
    "SENTENCE_2415": "Look, look!",
    "SENTENCE_2416": "Hmm?",
    "SENTENCE_2417": "No fair!",
    "SENTENCE_2418": "Humph. What's the matter with you? You scared?",
    "SENTENCE_2419": "All right!",
    "SENTENCE_2420": "You cannot beat me!",
    "SENTENCE_2421": "You think you can escape?",
    "SENTENCE_2422": "Playtime is over!",
    "SENTENCE_2423": "I am Super Vegito!",
    "SENTENCE_2424": "You really think you can beat me? I bet you can't.",
    "SENTENCE_2425": "There's no way you can win!",
    "SENTENCE_2426": "I am neither Goku nor Vegeta... I am the one who will destroy you!",
    "SENTENCE_2427": "Let me show you what fusion can do!",
    "SENTENCE_2428": "I am here to defeat you!",
    "SENTENCE_2429": "Just try to keep up with me!",
    "SENTENCE_2430": "Get ready!",
    "SENTENCE_2431": "Whoops! The fusion's gonna run out if I keep taking my sweet time!",
    "SENTENCE_2432": "Hey! What do you say to keeping this going a little longer?",
    "SENTENCE_2433": "I'll send you to the next world with this!",
    "SENTENCE_2434": "After all that talk, this is the best you can do? Here\r\nI assumed you were\r\nstronger than that.",
    "SENTENCE_2435": "I should be able to take care of you with just my pinky!",
    "SENTENCE_2436": "Time to wrap up this show!",
    "SENTENCE_2437": "Slowpoke.",
    "SENTENCE_2438": "Okay, let's go all out!",
    "SENTENCE_2439": "I want to enjoy this.",
    "SENTENCE_2440": "I am... the strongest!",
    "SENTENCE_2441": "Haha! You're underestimating my awesomeness!",
    "SENTENCE_2442": "Hehe!",
    "SENTENCE_2443": "That makes me mad... and you're gonna regret making me mad!",
    "SENTENCE_2444": "Screaming Angry Wombat!",
    "SENTENCE_2445": "You're too slow!",
    "SENTENCE_2446": "Huh?",
    "SENTENCE_2447": "It's finished...",
    "SENTENCE_2448": "You're not so tough!",
    "SENTENCE_2449": "Heh heh heh!",
    "SENTENCE_2450": "C'mon! We gotta keep attacking!",
    "SENTENCE_2451": "Ggh! Uh-oh!",
    "SENTENCE_2452": "Yeah, yeah, I know!",
    "SENTENCE_2453": "Dangit, I missed!",
    "SENTENCE_2454": "You better not complain when I kick your butt!",
    "SENTENCE_2455": "You wouldn't believe me if I told you that I used to be\r\nthe greatest martial\r\nartist in the world...",
    "SENTENCE_2456": "My eyes never deceive me.",
    "SENTENCE_2457": "You've still got some room for improvement.",
    "SENTENCE_2458": "Now learn what happens when you mess with the most\r\npowerful being in the universe!",
    "SENTENCE_2459": "Before you die, I shall leave you with one final vision \r\nmore terrifying than death itself!",
    "SENTENCE_2460": "Consider this my parting gift to you! A nightmare beyond the horrors of hell!\r\nWitness my true, ultimate form!",
    "SENTENCE_2461": "You'll find I have no intention of allowing even a single Saiyan to live!",
    "SENTENCE_2462": "You're in for a hard truth... I'm still the most powerful being in the universe!",
    "SENTENCE_2463": "If you had any hope left in your mind, you should know\r\nI haven't fully powered up yet!",
    "SENTENCE_2464": "Gh... The only one dying today is you!",
    "SENTENCE_2465": "Bwahahaha! Suffer!",
    "SENTENCE_2466": "What's wrong? Quivering with fear, are you?",
    "SENTENCE_2467": "Killing you quickly wouldn't be very enjoyable.",
    "SENTENCE_2468": "You're up to something, aren't you?",
    "SENTENCE_2469": "Spread the word to all...the Emperor of the Universe is back!",
    "SENTENCE_2470": "My apologies for the wait... As requested, this is my full power!",
    "SENTENCE_2471": "I am mighty, and you are not.",
    "SENTENCE_2472": "Let the festivities commence!",
    "SENTENCE_2473": "You're so pathetic, you're hardly worth killing.",
    "SENTENCE_2474": "Does this form make you tremble with fear?",
    "SENTENCE_2475": "Bow before my glistening golden glow!",
    "SENTENCE_2476": "Hmm... You are truly a formidable opponent, I'll give you that. Enjoy it while\r\nyou can...because once I achieve my perfect form, I'll crush you like a bug!",
    "SENTENCE_2477": "You should feel honored knowing that all of your strength and delicious\r\nbioenergy will bring me yet one step closer to my perfect form!",
    "SENTENCE_2478": "My name is Cell. I am an android created by Dr. Gero.",
    "SENTENCE_2479": "With all the power I've absorbed, there's no way you can possibly defeat me.",
    "SENTENCE_2480": "Heh heh heh... I guess I'm just too strong.",
    "SENTENCE_2481": "Did you really think that would impress me?",
    "SENTENCE_2482": "There's no point in running! Why don't you stay a while?",
    "SENTENCE_2483": "You're smart enough to know that you can't escape...\r\nGive in to me!",
    "SENTENCE_2484": "Resistance is futile...",
    "SENTENCE_2485": "Bwahahaha! Give me a break!",
    "SENTENCE_2486": "Damn...you...!",
    "SENTENCE_2487": "Don't pout. I'll kill you soon enough.",
    "SENTENCE_2488": "I wouldn't get too comfortable if I were you!",
    "SENTENCE_2489": "Hehehe! Surprised to see me?",
    "SENTENCE_2490": "Die!",
    "SENTENCE_2491": "Drmphneneh!",
    "SENTENCE_2492": "Gyaaah!",

    "SENTENCE_2505": "It seems you've finally realized... You have no chance\r\nof defeating me!",
    "SENTENCE_2506": "It's the birth of the mightiest Majin Buu...",
    "SENTENCE_2507": "Your death will be unimaginably painful!",

    "SENTENCE_2517": "I'm gonna mop the floor with ya! That's a Mr. Satan guarantee!",
    "SENTENCE_2518": "What's 16 plus 27?!",

    "SENTENCE_2528": "Just try to run away!",
    "SENTENCE_2529": "With the power I gained from merging with Buu... you're going down!",
    "SENTENCE_2530": "Surrender now, before you shove off this mortal coil!",
    "SENTENCE_2532": "You want to use the Dragon Balls more, to do bad things?",

    "SENTENCE_2592": "Heeheeheeheehee! Now then, how shall I torture you\r\nbefore I end it all?",
    "SENTENCE_2593": "Allow me to introduce myself. The handsome devil you\r\nsee before you is the great wizard Babidi!",
    "SENTENCE_2594": "Bah. That's quite enough of your useless chatter. Come at me!",

    "SENTENCE_2718": "You haven't realized... I've already skipped ahead of you.",
    "SENTENCE_2719": "No strategy can overcome my time skip. Say goodnight.",

    "SENTENCE_2872": "This is pathetic. Get it together!",
    "SENTENCE_2873": "Yowch... You're a tough one!",
    "SENTENCE_2874": "Hey, don't get hurt now!",
    "SENTENCE_2875": "I might end up getting yelled at...",
    "SENTENCE_2876": "You piece of...",
    "SENTENCE_2877": "You're going to pay for that...!",
    "SENTENCE_2878": "And that's how it is.",
    "SENTENCE_2879": "Why don't you just give up?!",
    "SENTENCE_2880": "No way!",
    "SENTENCE_2881": "Give me a break!",
    "SENTENCE_2882": "How dare you mock me...!",
    "SENTENCE_2883": "I'll be beating you fair and square.",
    "SENTENCE_2884": "Uh-oh! This is bad!",
    "SENTENCE_2885": "I'll have to get strong for real...",
    "SENTENCE_2886": "I see...",
    "SENTENCE_2887": "So that's why you called us in, eh?",
    "SENTENCE_2888": "I can't lose...!",
    "SENTENCE_2889": "Guess that's how it's gotta be.",
    "SENTENCE_2890": "I won't go easy on you.",
    "SENTENCE_2891": "This is going better than I thought...",
    "SENTENCE_2892": "Is that enough?",
    "SENTENCE_2893": "That should do it.",
    "SENTENCE_2894": "Thank you so much!",
    "SENTENCE_2895": "You're sitting out the tournament, right?",
    "SENTENCE_2896": "Please don't get hurt.",
    "SENTENCE_2897": "Go easy on me, okay...?",
    "SENTENCE_2898": "Yeah, I'm really feeling it now!",
    "SENTENCE_2899": "N-no more...",
    "SENTENCE_2900": "I see...",
    "SENTENCE_2901": "I think I can win this!",
    "SENTENCE_2902": "Let's call it a day here.",
    "SENTENCE_2903": "I'm still a little worried...",
    "SENTENCE_2904": "Here I go, everyone! Cheer me on!",
    "SENTENCE_2905": "Show me the results of your training!",
    "SENTENCE_2906": "Come on, you're stronger than this!",
    "SENTENCE_2907": "Urk... Waaaaaargh!",
    "SENTENCE_2908": "You didn't accomplish anything.",
    "SENTENCE_2909": "I'm done... I can't win this...",
    "SENTENCE_2910": "Guess that's how it's gotta be.",
    "SENTENCE_2911": "Gwaaargh! You got me!",
    "SENTENCE_2912": "We'll do great, trust me!",
    "SENTENCE_2913": "Whooooooa!",
    "SENTENCE_2914": "Stay confident!",
    "SENTENCE_2915": "I'm heading out!",
    "SENTENCE_2916": "I'm not so sure about this...",
    "SENTENCE_2917": "On the day...",
    "SENTENCE_2918": "Don't act so uptight. Loosen up a little!",
    "SENTENCE_2919": "O-okay...",
    "SENTENCE_2920": "I've just got to give it my best shot...!",
    "SENTENCE_2921": "D-did I win...?",
    "SENTENCE_2922": "Hey!",
    "SENTENCE_2923": "Your battle was so exciting, I couldn't help myself!",
    "SENTENCE_2924": "Well, uh... It's like, you know...",
    "SENTENCE_2925": "Mr. Satan may have gotten stronger, but still...",
    "SENTENCE_2926": "We won't know until we try!",
    "SENTENCE_2927": "Maybe some other time...",
    "SENTENCE_2928": "I can't win this...",
    "SENTENCE_2929": "Okay, time for Plan B!",
    "SENTENCE_2930": "Ow-ow-ow!",
    "SENTENCE_2931": "Did that do it?",
    "SENTENCE_2932": "I'm sure you've become quite the force to reckon with!",
    "SENTENCE_2933": "Maybe a little show of your new-found strength\r\nwill put you in their good books!",
    "SENTENCE_2934": "So be it!",
    "SENTENCE_2935": "Please don't disappoint me!",
    "SENTENCE_2936": "You little...!",
    "SENTENCE_2937": "Agh... They're really mad...",
    "SENTENCE_2938": "It was the only thing I could do...!",
    "SENTENCE_2939": "Wow! Thank you very much!",
    "SENTENCE_2940": "Does Captain Ginyu know about this...?",
    "SENTENCE_2941": "My other form...",
    "SENTENCE_2942": "Aghhh...",
    "SENTENCE_2943": "Quit squirming around!",
    "SENTENCE_2944": "Still haven't learned your lesson, huh?",
    "SENTENCE_2945": "I might possibly get myself killed...",
    "SENTENCE_2946": "I guess you leave me no other choice...",
    "SENTENCE_2947": "This is my reward to you for all your valiant efforts!",
    "SENTENCE_2948": "What else could possibly happen...?!",
    "SENTENCE_2949": "Yeesh... That's one gruesome strategy!",
    "SENTENCE_2950": "Why...",
    "SENTENCE_2951": "They sure do look strong...",
    "SENTENCE_2952": "I actually won...",
    "SENTENCE_2953": "Let's go, troops! Show me what you've got!",
    "SENTENCE_2954": "Uwahahahaha!",
    "SENTENCE_2955": "Try hard enough and they may forgive you.",
    "SENTENCE_2956": "And they all lived happily ever after.",
    "SENTENCE_2957": "Can't you see? You're no match for me!",
    "SENTENCE_2958": "I am sorry...",
    "SENTENCE_2959": "You've lost your break privileges for a while.",
    "SENTENCE_2960": "Hope you're ready to work hard!",
    "SENTENCE_2961": "Yeah...",
    "SENTENCE_2962": "Think you can prove your worth to me?",
    "SENTENCE_2963": "Well, now...",
    "SENTENCE_2964": "Let's see what you've got first.",
    "SENTENCE_2965": "You're a lucky one.",
    "SENTENCE_2966": "What are you talking about?",
    "SENTENCE_2967": "Hey, don't go blabbing about that!",
    "SENTENCE_2968": "Come at me like you mean to kill me.",
    "SENTENCE_2969": "Heheh, that's been my plan from the start!",
    "SENTENCE_2970": "Okay, here I go!",
    "SENTENCE_2971": "Fool...",
    "SENTENCE_2972": "I should have killed you sooner...",
    "SENTENCE_2973": "I let my guard down.",
    "SENTENCE_2974": "This ends now.",
    "SENTENCE_2975": "I-I'm sorry...",
    "SENTENCE_2976": "Splendid!",
    "SENTENCE_2977": "Your skills are commendable!",
    "SENTENCE_2978": "Why do I have to do this...?",
    "SENTENCE_2979": "You're quite persistent.",
    "SENTENCE_2980": "Let's do this!",
    "SENTENCE_2981": "I'm not going down without a fight!",
    "SENTENCE_2982": "Let's hope that's actually true...",
    "SENTENCE_2983": "Oh my...",
    "SENTENCE_2984": "Such an unrefined fighting style.",
    "SENTENCE_2985": "Tch... What a boorish technique.",
    "SENTENCE_2986": "How dare you...!",
    "SENTENCE_2987": "Play...?",
    "SENTENCE_2988": "I can't let that slide.",
    "SENTENCE_2989": "Do you understand the position you're in?",
    "SENTENCE_2990": "Quit moving around so much...!",
    "SENTENCE_2991": "Too bad all your tricks will be for nothing.",
    "SENTENCE_2992": "Disappear!",
    "SENTENCE_2993": "Oh... Now this is magnificent!",
    "SENTENCE_2994": "I'll be counting on you.",
    "SENTENCE_2995": "Like this...",
    "SENTENCE_2996": "I'll send you to keep the rest of the monkeys company in the Other World!",
    "SENTENCE_2997": "I simply have no need for weaklings!",
    "SENTENCE_2998": "F-for real?!",
    "SENTENCE_2999": "Hyaaaah!",
    "SENTENCE_3000": "I wasn't trying THAT hard...",
    "SENTENCE_3001": "Gwaaah!",
    "SENTENCE_3002": "Idiot! You have to dodge it!",
    "SENTENCE_3003": "Quit scampering around so much!",
    "SENTENCE_3004": "I can't help it...",
    "SENTENCE_3005": "Don't worry. I'll hold back so you won't die!",
    "SENTENCE_3006": "Huff...haah... I'm exhausted...",
    "SENTENCE_3007": "You're tired already? How disappointing.",
    "SENTENCE_3008": "Eeeeeek!",
    "SENTENCE_3009": "Just make sure you keep your promise.",
    "SENTENCE_3025": "Prove your worth to me.",
    "SENTENCE_3037": "What's up with that form...",
    "SENTENCE_3039": "Ugah...!",
    "SENTENCE_3044": "You took it too far!",
    "SENTENCE_3045": "You're at the top of my list...",
    "SENTENCE_3046": "Can't believe I got roped into this crap.",
    "SENTENCE_3049": "I brought you all here for a very good reason.",
    "SENTENCE_3050": "I'm well aware of how strong you all are.",
    "SENTENCE_3051": "Oh? I'd like to hear more about that.",
    "SENTENCE_3052": "Tell me more.",
    "SENTENCE_3053": "Heheh... How rare it is for us to agree on something.",
    "SENTENCE_3054": "Once they're weakened, it's time to really make them suffer.",
    "SENTENCE_3055": "Things are getting exciting!",
    "SENTENCE_3056": "I'll obliterate that fool with my own two hands!",
    "SENTENCE_3057": "A little provoking could go a long way.",
    "SENTENCE_3058": "Are you trying to make me mad?",
    "SENTENCE_3059": "Humph. So naive.",
    "SENTENCE_3060": "It's no use apologizing now!",
    "SENTENCE_3061": "Oh dear. Is that all you've got?",
    "SENTENCE_3062": "You've got more fight in you than that, don't you?",
    "SENTENCE_3063": "Without further ado...let my vengeance begin.",
    "SENTENCE_3064": "All right, let's do our best.",
    "SENTENCE_3065": "Ow, ow, ow...",
    "SENTENCE_3066": "Beating you isn't going to be easy...",
    "SENTENCE_3067": "I'm at my limit...",
    "SENTENCE_3068": "I'm up against a wall here...",
    "SENTENCE_3069": "You're all too soft. Let me take over.",
    "SENTENCE_3070": "We need to fight smarter, not harder. Allow me.",
    "SENTENCE_3071": "You need to put more heart into it! Let me show you!",
    "SENTENCE_3072": "What are you waiting for?!",
    "SENTENCE_3073": "You don't get to rest!",
    "SENTENCE_3074": "Time for a beating!",
    "SENTENCE_3075": "That was amazing!",
    "SENTENCE_3076": "Not bad at all.",
    "SENTENCE_3077": "Ohohohooo!",
    "SENTENCE_3078": "Ahahahaha!",
    "SENTENCE_3079": "Heheheh...",
    "SENTENCE_3080": "You need to at least imagine you can win!",
    "SENTENCE_3081": "Hmmm...",
    "SENTENCE_3082": "This is a tough one...",
    "SENTENCE_3083": "Keep it together.",
    "SENTENCE_3084": "One more time!",
    "SENTENCE_3085": "Fine by me.",
    "SENTENCE_3086": "Right...!",
    "SENTENCE_3087": "There you are!",
    "SENTENCE_3088": "Hey! Get down here!",
    "SENTENCE_3089": "Whoa! It's like looking into a mirror!",
    "SENTENCE_3090": "Can't tell the two of 'em apart...",
    "SENTENCE_3091": "Who the hell are you people?!",
    "SENTENCE_3092": "Um, I'm not sure how to put this...",
    "SENTENCE_3093": "Well... You see...",
    "SENTENCE_3094": "Quit stalling! It won't work!",
    "SENTENCE_3095": "Would you prefer that I beat a response out of you?!",
    "SENTENCE_3096": "Hey, whoa! No need to lose your cool!",
    "SENTENCE_3097": "Show me what you've got.",
    "SENTENCE_3098": "Another one...?",
    "SENTENCE_3099": "Just hear me out!",
    "SENTENCE_3100": "Shut up! I don't need your excuses!",
    "SENTENCE_3101": "Shall we let this play out for now?",
    "SENTENCE_3102": "No, I've seen enough.",
    "SENTENCE_3103": "Don't go acting all high and mighty, now.",
    "SENTENCE_3104": "Fine. Suit yourself.",
    "SENTENCE_3105": "Naturally, you can transform, too.",
    "SENTENCE_3106": "Of course. Don't underestimate me.",
    "SENTENCE_3107": "Oh! This just got interesting!",
    "SENTENCE_3108": "That's more like it.",
    "SENTENCE_3109": "Here goes nothing!",
    "SENTENCE_3110": "I see... Can't say I expected that.",
    "SENTENCE_3111": "Let's find out who's stronger.",
    "SENTENCE_3112": "Obviously, it's me.",
    "SENTENCE_3113": "Attack me, if you are so bold!",
    "SENTENCE_3114": "We did it... We won...",
    "SENTENCE_3115": "You could use some more training.",
    "SENTENCE_3116": "Tch...",
    "SENTENCE_3117": "Let 'em get away...",
    "SENTENCE_3118": "Hmm...",
    "SENTENCE_3119": "Come on, get up! Just shake it off!",
    "SENTENCE_3120": "I sensed some bad energy, so I headed over here... It was you, huh.",
    "SENTENCE_3121": "I think I've heard enough.",
    "SENTENCE_3122": "I'll surpass you someday!",
    "SENTENCE_3123": "Heheh... How amusing.",
    "SENTENCE_3124": "Come at me!",
    "SENTENCE_3125": "Heheh... Nice attack!",
    "SENTENCE_3126": "You can do better, right?",
    "SENTENCE_3127": "This is not good!",
    "SENTENCE_3128": "That all you got?",
    "SENTENCE_3129": "This is no fun.",
    "SENTENCE_3130": "Not excited yet, huh. Well...",
    "SENTENCE_3131": "I'm only gonna get stronger from here!",
    "SENTENCE_3132": "What should I do...?!",
    "SENTENCE_3133": "You're tougher than you look.",
    "SENTENCE_3134": "Get a load of this!",
    "SENTENCE_3135": "Too bad! Try again another time!",
    "SENTENCE_3136": "Hey! What's up?",
    "SENTENCE_3137": "Next time, I'll take you out before you know what hit you.",
    "SENTENCE_3138": "Remember this...!",
    "SENTENCE_3139": "See ya! Come back again sometime!",
    "SENTENCE_3140": "So uncool!",
    "SENTENCE_3141": "Watch from down there in the dirt...",
    "SENTENCE_3142": "They are the ones who will change the future...",
    "SENTENCE_3143": "I just happened to be here as well.",
    "SENTENCE_3144": "That's about right.",
    "SENTENCE_3145": "I thought I killed you already!",
    "SENTENCE_3146": "How troublesome...",
    "SENTENCE_3147": "I heard you the first time.",
    "SENTENCE_3148": "God vs. God",
    "SENTENCE_3149": "Fight hard, now!",
    "SENTENCE_3150": "Got it!",
    "SENTENCE_3151": "If there's no other way, then...",
    "SENTENCE_3152": "I guess I could help out.",
    "SENTENCE_3153": "You're really getting on my nerves.",
    "SENTENCE_3154": "Don't blame me!",
    "SENTENCE_3155": "Let me in on this.",
    "SENTENCE_3156": "Ngh... You're not too shabby!",
    "SENTENCE_3157": "I can't stand here and watch this.",
    "SENTENCE_3158": "Stand down!",
    "SENTENCE_3159": "Damn you... You're a lot stronger than expected...",
    "SENTENCE_3160": "That was a close one. I almost went completely overboard.",
    "SENTENCE_3161": "*sigh* Are you ready now?",
    "SENTENCE_3162": "At this rate, I'm gonna lose!",
    "SENTENCE_3163": "That should do it.",
    "SENTENCE_3164": "Well, that's too bad.",
    "SENTENCE_3165": "Of course.",
    "SENTENCE_3166": "What is it?",
    "SENTENCE_3167": "Yeah, yeah, I got it!",
    "SENTENCE_3168": "Sorry, I had to kick it up a notch there.",
    "SENTENCE_3169": "I'd say having a kind heart is a good thing...",
    "SENTENCE_3170": "Oh, shut up...",
    "SENTENCE_3203": "Okay...",
    "SENTENCE_3231": "Ugyagyagyaaa!",
    "SENTENCE_3232": "Kreeeeee...!",
    "SENTENCE_3233": "You dare to attack us...?!",
    "SENTENCE_3234": "I'm afraid I can't let that happen.",
    "SENTENCE_3235": "Gya-gya!",
    "SENTENCE_3236": "You can't beat me with a puny power level like that.",
    "SENTENCE_3237": "You'll pay for your insolence!",
    "SENTENCE_3238": "I have no idea what you're talking about.",
    "SENTENCE_3239": "Enough! I'm done playing games with you.",
    "SENTENCE_3240": "Why do I have to be the welcome party?",
    "SENTENCE_3241": "Hold on a sec!",
    "SENTENCE_3242": "You won't get in my way!",
    "SENTENCE_3243": "So, there's your answer...",
    "SENTENCE_3244": "I must ask you to leave.",
    "SENTENCE_3245": "You piece of—",
    "SENTENCE_3246": "You're gonna have to force me to stop!",
    "SENTENCE_3247": "Give me a turn!",
    "SENTENCE_3248": "You've got some nerve, making me wait like this...",
    "SENTENCE_3249": "Wow!",
    "SENTENCE_3250": "O-ow...",
    "SENTENCE_3251": "Go ahead and do as you wish...",
    "SENTENCE_3252": "It's no use getting mad at me, you know.",
    "SENTENCE_3253": "Oh no... I'm gonna be in so much trouble!",
    "SENTENCE_3254": "Damn it... Out of my way!",
    "SENTENCE_3255": "But I still want to play!",
    "SENTENCE_3256": "Why me?!",
    "SENTENCE_3257": "All right!",
    "SENTENCE_3258": "I'm going to end this! Now!",
    "SENTENCE_3259": "Better head back soon...",
    "SENTENCE_3260": "Sorry...",
    "SENTENCE_3261": "Hey...",
    "SENTENCE_3262": "Haah...haah... How's that...?",
    "SENTENCE_3263": "Yeah, yeah, sure...",
    "SENTENCE_3264": "What?!",
    "SENTENCE_3265": "Watch and learn.",
    "SENTENCE_3266": "Time to go home!",
    "SENTENCE_3267": "I'm still not convinced...",
    "SENTENCE_3269": "The most musclebound fighters you'll ever meet, it's Team Macho!",

    "SENTENCE_3275": "Looks like someone's having trouble.",
    "SENTENCE_3276": "What happened here?",
    "SENTENCE_3277": "What's up with that form...",
    "SENTENCE_3278": "Shut up and get it together!",
    "SENTENCE_3279": "Come on out!",
    "SENTENCE_3280": "Don't make me any angrier...!",
    "SENTENCE_3281": "We're already done here?",
    "SENTENCE_3282": "Then how about this?!",
    "SENTENCE_3283": "Heheh. Blinded, aren't you?",
    "SENTENCE_3284": "Ohohoho! That won't work against me.",
    "SENTENCE_3285": "Heheh... You'll never defeat me like that.",
    "SENTENCE_3286": "Whoops, looks like I destroyed my sunglasses.",
    "SENTENCE_3287": "Whoa! Hey, what are you doing?!",
    "SENTENCE_3288": "Urgh...! I can't see...!",
    "SENTENCE_3289": "Come at me whenever you want, I'll still be ready for you!",
    "SENTENCE_3290": "Okay, I'm on it!",
    "SENTENCE_3291": "Come at me with all your strength!",
    "SENTENCE_3292": "R-right...!",
    "SENTENCE_3293": "Nicely done, Raditz!",
    "SENTENCE_3294": "I sense something in that direction...",
    "SENTENCE_3295": "This time, for sure!",
    "SENTENCE_3296": "Fight me one on one, you cowards!",
    "SENTENCE_3297": "Where to next?",
    "SENTENCE_3298": "What's that supposed to mean?!",
    "SENTENCE_3299": "What, there's more...?",
    "SENTENCE_3300": "Like I said, I don't know what you're talking about!",
    "SENTENCE_3301": "Hmm...?",
    "SENTENCE_3302": "What do you mean?",
    "SENTENCE_3303": "Good point.",
    "SENTENCE_3304": "What are you muttering about?!",
    "SENTENCE_3305": "Meanwhile...",
    "SENTENCE_3306": "Damn it, we're running out of time!",
    "SENTENCE_3307": "Fight me!",

    "SENTENCE_3312": "Why should we stop them?",
    "SENTENCE_3313": "This is bad, real bad!",
    "SENTENCE_3314": "If it's something I need to do to be able to fight with you,\r\nthen I guess it cannot be helped.",
    "SENTENCE_3315": "Who's going to be first?",
    "SENTENCE_3316": "Don't tell me what to do!",
    "SENTENCE_3317": "Back off, I'll handle this!",
    "SENTENCE_3318": "Okay, switch out!",
    "SENTENCE_3319": "Are you done?",
    "SENTENCE_3320": "You look quite promising.",
    "SENTENCE_3321": "Something's giving me some bad vibes...",
    "SENTENCE_3322": "That was a bust...",
    "SENTENCE_3323": "Think we got a little too into it?",
    "SENTENCE_3324": "I don't give a damn about that.",
    "SENTENCE_3325": "I will eliminate anyone who stands in my way.",
    "SENTENCE_3326": "One way or another, you're going down!",
    "SENTENCE_3327": "Please, lend me your power!",
    "SENTENCE_3328": "Got it!",
    "SENTENCE_3329": "I don't have the option to be picky.",
    "SENTENCE_3330": "Humph. You were barely any help at all.",
    "SENTENCE_3331": "Quiet, you!",
    "SENTENCE_3332": "Now, what to do with you...?",
    "SENTENCE_3333": "Urk! I dunno about this...",
    "SENTENCE_3334": "Hey! Get a hold of yourself!",
    "SENTENCE_3335": "What are you doing here?!",
    "SENTENCE_3336": "We need to settle this...",
    "SENTENCE_3337": "It's about time I got serious.",
    "SENTENCE_3338": "You mean you're not going to fight me...?!",
    "SENTENCE_3339": "I'm gonna eat ya all!",
    "SENTENCE_3340": "Yeah! I mean, probably.",
    "SENTENCE_3341": "I'll make you regret ever coming back.",
    "SENTENCE_3342": "Phew... Thanks for that!",
    "SENTENCE_3343": "You were good for killing some time.",
    "SENTENCE_3344": "It'd be such a waste to end things here, don't you think?",
    "SENTENCE_3345": "All right. Another time, then.",
    "SENTENCE_3346": "I'll be looking forward to it.",
    "SENTENCE_3347": "But first, we need to make it back alive.",
    "SENTENCE_3348": "Okay, switch with me.",
    "SENTENCE_3349": "This power is incredible!",
    "SENTENCE_3350": "I'll make this quick.",
    "SENTENCE_3351": "Try and catch me if you can!",
    "SENTENCE_3352": "You disappoint me!",
    "SENTENCE_3353": "I'll win even faster next time!",
    "SENTENCE_3354": "All that speed won't mean a thing.",
    "SENTENCE_3355": "I won't know if I don't try!",
    "SENTENCE_3356": "You'll be dead before you know it.",
    "SENTENCE_3357": "What a joke. Is dodging and running all you know how to do?",
    "SENTENCE_3358": "Heheheh... Nothing I can't handle.",
    "SENTENCE_3359": "You're so slow! Are you even moving at all?",
    "SENTENCE_3360": "Think you can keep up with me?",
    "SENTENCE_3361": "I was about to say the same thing!",
    "SENTENCE_3362": "Didn't you say you were faster than me?",
    "SENTENCE_3363": "Grrrn...",
    "SENTENCE_3364": "So fast...!",
    "SENTENCE_3365": "Stopping time? What a dirty trick!",
    "SENTENCE_3366": "Suck it up.",
    "SENTENCE_3367": "What delightful poses. You're very cool.",
    "SENTENCE_3368": "Heheh, feeling jealous?",
    "SENTENCE_3369": "Shut your mouth!",
    "SENTENCE_3370": "You're so slow I could take a nap!",
    "SENTENCE_3371": "Don't get ahead of yourself!",
    "SENTENCE_3372": "Uh-oh...",
    "SENTENCE_3373": "They're getting even stronger...",
    "SENTENCE_3374": "Use whatever attack you want. It won't do you any good.",
    "SENTENCE_3375": "I don't know what you're up to...",
    "SENTENCE_3376": "Tch... How can this be?!",
    "SENTENCE_3377": "Nice! It's about time we had a proper fight!",
    "SENTENCE_3378": "What?!",
    "SENTENCE_3379": "You fool...!",
    "SENTENCE_3380": "You're as short tempered as ever, I see.",
    "SENTENCE_3381": "Yeah, now I'm feeling it!",
    "SENTENCE_3382": "I can't lose here...!",
    "SENTENCE_3383": "Well, now!",
    "SENTENCE_3384": "It's me!",
    "SENTENCE_3385": "Let's do this again sometime!",
    "SENTENCE_3386": "Heheh... Don't go dying on me now.",
    "SENTENCE_3387": "I didn't think you were this careless.",
    "SENTENCE_3388": "You shouldn't underestimate me.",
    "SENTENCE_3389": "Tch...!",
    "SENTENCE_3390": "Oh? I remember seeing this form before...",
    "SENTENCE_3391": "Nice to know somebody gets it.",
    "SENTENCE_3392": "I don't know about that...!",
    "SENTENCE_3393": "You really know how to fire up your opponent.",
    "SENTENCE_3394": "Tch... You're pretty good.",
    "SENTENCE_3395": "Wow, this is pretty fun! Who wants to take me on next?",
    "SENTENCE_3396": "I shall not hold back!",
    "SENTENCE_3397": "Hmm, not bad...",
    "SENTENCE_3398": "I can't stand to watch this...",
    "SENTENCE_3399": "I'll be the one to defeat you!",
    "SENTENCE_3400": "So in the end, it was all for nothing? This can't be...",
    "SENTENCE_3401": "In that case, you'll have to keep me entertained yourself!",
    "SENTENCE_3402": "Did eating that fruit cause this surge in power...?!",
    "SENTENCE_3403": "Humph! If you think I'll let you surpass me, you've got another thing coming.",
    "SENTENCE_3404": "We need to finish this before it's too late!",
    "SENTENCE_3405": "If they get any stronger, we won't stand a chance!",
    "SENTENCE_3406": "I have to do something...!",
    "SENTENCE_3407": "Th-they got even stronger?!",
    "SENTENCE_3408": "We have to finish this soon...",
    "SENTENCE_3409": "Where is all this power coming from...?!",
    "SENTENCE_3410": "Just how many of those things do you have?",
    "SENTENCE_3411": "Hey, my outfit is cool! It's the coolest! You should wear one, too!",
    "SENTENCE_3412": "Uh-oh, I'm really in for it now...",
    "SENTENCE_3413": "Most displeasing...",
    "SENTENCE_3414": "Is that even going to work?",
    "SENTENCE_3415": "Then I'll just fight them again and convince them that way.",
    "SENTENCE_3416": "See ya!",
    "SENTENCE_3417": "Wow! It's been a while, huh?",
    "SENTENCE_3418": "Gwah...?",
    "SENTENCE_3419": "Whoa, you're here too?",
    "SENTENCE_3420": "Gah-gah-garrrgh!",
    "SENTENCE_3421": "You'll get to fight lots of strong opponents.",
    "SENTENCE_3422": "Oho? Now you've got my attention.",
    "SENTENCE_3423": "I assume you'll be taking part as well?",
    "SENTENCE_3424": "Very well. You can count me in.",
    "SENTENCE_3425": "I'll think about it...after I kill you!",
    "SENTENCE_3426": "Why should I listen to a thing you say?",
    "SENTENCE_3427": "I'll enjoy showing your corpse to your adoring public.",
    "SENTENCE_3428": "I'm not going to let that happen!",
    "SENTENCE_3429": "Give me some time to think about it.",
    "SENTENCE_3430": "I will NOT lose to you again!",
    "SENTENCE_3431": "Ah!",
    "SENTENCE_3432": "Good morning. Did you sleep well?",
    "SENTENCE_3433": "I hope it's not going to play out the way I think it's going to.",
    "SENTENCE_3434": "Come at me all at once.",
    "SENTENCE_3435": "Was THAT your full strength?",
    "SENTENCE_3436": "Nope, no good.",
    "SENTENCE_3437": "Sorry, but that won't work on me.",
    "SENTENCE_3438": "You'll get no mercy from me!",
    "SENTENCE_3439": "One blow is all it'll take.",
    "SENTENCE_3440": "Don't worry, I won't draw out your suffering.",
    "SENTENCE_3441": "Looks like you won't go down so easily...",
    "SENTENCE_3442": "If I lose...",
    "SENTENCE_3443": "I can't protect anything...!",
    "SENTENCE_3444": "I'm your opponent now.",
    "SENTENCE_3445": "Not bad.",
    "SENTENCE_3446": "I'm not going down without a fight!",
    "SENTENCE_3447": "This tournament is a joke.",
    "SENTENCE_3448": "I'm...losing? Impossible...!",
    "SENTENCE_3449": "I won't let someone like you get in my way!",
    "SENTENCE_3450": "If you can beat me, you win the whole thing!",
    "SENTENCE_3451": "I can't wait to find out how strong you are!",
    "SENTENCE_3452": "Heheh... I'm so glad.",
    "SENTENCE_3453": "What an attack! Is there any coming back from that...?",
    "SENTENCE_3454": "Oh? You managed to defend against that. I'm impressed.",
    "SENTENCE_3455": "It's an onslaught of vicious attacks!",
    "SENTENCE_3456": "Who'd have thought they were hiding such power?",
    "SENTENCE_3457": "A new martial arts champion is crowned here and now!",
    "SENTENCE_3458": "I'm all the protection this planet needs.",
    "SENTENCE_3459": "Let's get this over with.",
    "SENTENCE_3460": "I didn't think I'd have to fight someone so strong!",
    "SENTENCE_3461": "No one told me about this!",
    "SENTENCE_3462": "Tch...",
    "SENTENCE_3463": "It's time to end this.",
    "SENTENCE_3464": "Don't get cocky! Our fight's not over yet.",
    "SENTENCE_3465": "Things must be bad if you're calling on me.",
    "SENTENCE_3466": "You're pretty good at this.",
    "SENTENCE_3467": "Th-this can't be...!",
    "SENTENCE_3468": "BUU!",
    "SENTENCE_3469": "Urh... Nrrrgh...",
    "SENTENCE_3470": "There's no way I'd ever forget that face...",
    "SENTENCE_3471": "Please, you have to find a way to stop this!",
    "SENTENCE_3472": "That was barely worth the effort.",
    "SENTENCE_3473": "Just a little more! You can do it!",
    "SENTENCE_3474": "Graaaugh...!",
    "SENTENCE_3475": "GAAAAAAGH!",
    "SENTENCE_3476": "You've got this. You can do it!",
    "SENTENCE_3477": "Almost there...!",
    "SENTENCE_3478": "Eeeyeeeuuurgh!",
    "SENTENCE_3479": "Just what in the heck do you think you're doing?",
    "SENTENCE_3480": "How could this happen...?",
    "SENTENCE_3481": "Uhgyeee!",
    "SENTENCE_3482": "Looks like you're not beaten just yet.",
    "SENTENCE_3483": "Now is the time! It's up to you now!",
    "SENTENCE_3484": "You have to win this!",
    "SENTENCE_3485": "It's all up to you now...",
    "SENTENCE_3496": "I can still keep up with you young folks just fine.",
    "SENTENCE_3497": "Darn it!",
    "SENTENCE_3498": "You won't be laughing for much longer!",
    "SENTENCE_3499": "Here I come, Grandpa!",
    "SENTENCE_3500": "I'm stronger than you now? No way!",
    "SENTENCE_3501": "Ohohohoh. I'm glad to see you so fit and healthy.",
    "SENTENCE_3502": "I'm really hungry now...",
    "SENTENCE_3503": "I have no power...",
    "SENTENCE_3508": "Brace yourself! They're coming!",
    "SENTENCE_3520": "All right! Got 'em!",
    "SENTENCE_3521": "Even I get bored of just destroying things all the time.",
    "SENTENCE_3522": "Why don't we play something different?",
    "SENTENCE_3523": "Hmm... Yeah, maybe you're right.",
    "SENTENCE_3524": "Hey, you all over there...!",
    "SENTENCE_3525": "You're the ones who are going down!",
    "SENTENCE_3526": "G-got it!",
    "SENTENCE_3527": "Figured you'd be tough...",
    "SENTENCE_3528": "Okay, this'll end it!",
    "SENTENCE_3529": "I'm ready! Who wants to be first?",
    "SENTENCE_3530": "I'm coming after you next!",
    "SENTENCE_3531": "Gimme a break...",
    "SENTENCE_3532": "You won't win that easily.",
    "SENTENCE_3533": "You finally won!",
    "SENTENCE_3534": "That hair... That tail...",
    "SENTENCE_3535": "Treat me to something tasty after this.",
    "SENTENCE_3536": "Okay. Got it.",
    "SENTENCE_3537": "Remember this, though...",
    "SENTENCE_3538": "*yawn* This is boring.",
    "SENTENCE_3539": "Oh no... They're getting bored!",
    "SENTENCE_3540": "I'm bored. It's time to end this!",
    "SENTENCE_3541": "Not too shabby.",
    "SENTENCE_3542": "Good! That's what I like to see.",
    "SENTENCE_3543": "Things are getting interesting.",
    "SENTENCE_3544": "Yeah! That one did some damage!",
    "SENTENCE_3545": "I'm just going easy on you.",
    "SENTENCE_3546": "You don't actually think you can beat me, do you?",
    "SENTENCE_3547": "N-no...",
    "SENTENCE_3548": "(I shouldn't say anything that'll set them off...)",
    "SENTENCE_3549": "I'll give you everything I've got.",
    "SENTENCE_3550": "As you wish.",
    "SENTENCE_3551": "Now you're getting the hang of it! Try to keep that up.",
    "SENTENCE_3552": "How...infuriating. How could this happen to me...?",
    "SENTENCE_3553": "C'mon, no need to get so worked up about it.",
    "SENTENCE_3554": "Humph...",
    "SENTENCE_3555": "My body feels a lot lighter now!",
    "SENTENCE_3556": "Looks like you're recovered a little.",
    "SENTENCE_3557": "I can feel the ki coursing through me...",
    "SENTENCE_3558": "All riiight! Let's do this!",
    "SENTENCE_3559": "This is getting tedious.",
    "SENTENCE_3560": "Oho, I'm impressed...",
    "SENTENCE_3561": "I'm tired of looking at that ridiculous face of yours.",
    "SENTENCE_3562": "Now, die.",
    "SENTENCE_3563": "Aw, my clothes are ruined.",
    "SENTENCE_3564": "Whatever you're about to do, I'm ready for it.",
    "SENTENCE_3565": "A flash of light...?",
    "SENTENCE_3566": "W-well, if you say so...",
    "SENTENCE_3567": "This is no time to coward out!",
    "SENTENCE_3568": "I'll do whatever it takes to win.",
    "SENTENCE_3569": "Thought that'd take you out. It's on, now.",
    "SENTENCE_3570": "Try to put up a fight.",
    "SENTENCE_3571": "I'm going to take you out with me.",
    "SENTENCE_3572": "The kid's doing their best.",
    "SENTENCE_3573": "Yeah.",
    "SENTENCE_3574": "Heheheh...",
    "SENTENCE_3575": "You'll have to do better than that to stop me.",
    "SENTENCE_3576": "Wow, a direct hit!",
    "SENTENCE_3577": "No need to hold back against me.",
    "SENTENCE_3578": "Don't hold back. Go all out from the start.",
    "SENTENCE_3579": "That's all you brought to this fight? What a disappointment...",
    "SENTENCE_3580": "You can do better than that.",
    "SENTENCE_3581": "I hope you don't regret this.",
    "SENTENCE_3582": "You okay?",
    "SENTENCE_3583": "Huh. That wasn't so hard.",
    "SENTENCE_3584": "Quit playing around, let's finish this!",
    "SENTENCE_3585": "The heck are you doing?",
    "SENTENCE_3586": "You're such a slob.",
    "SENTENCE_3587": "Just be quiet for a minute!",
    "SENTENCE_3588": "This changes nothing. The plan can still proceed as planned!",
    "SENTENCE_3590": "Is that old timer...okay?",
    "SENTENCE_3591": "You're not the only ones who can fuse.",
    "SENTENCE_3592": "And so...",
    "SENTENCE_3606": "Will things go according to my plan...?",
    "SENTENCE_3607": "I'm going all the way to the top!",
    "SENTENCE_3608": "I had a bad feeling, so I headed over here. It was you, huh.",
    "SENTENCE_3609": "Quite intriguing, is it...",
    "SENTENCE_3610": "Did you hear that just now?",
    "SENTENCE_3611": "Yeah.",
    "SENTENCE_3612": "That's the stuff.",
    "SENTENCE_3613": "Let's finish this ourselves, once and for all.",
    "SENTENCE_3614": "Let's start by taking care of the others.",
    "SENTENCE_3615": "No point if either of them get taken out, after all.",
    "SENTENCE_3616": "Trust me, I know.",
    "SENTENCE_3617": "You stay out of this!",
    "SENTENCE_3618": "Leave me out of pointless stuff.",
    "SENTENCE_3619": "Time to die.",
    "SENTENCE_3620": "I'll make you into a stepping stone for us.",
    "SENTENCE_3621": "Right... How about them?",
    "SENTENCE_3622": "Whoa! Where the heck did that come from?!",
    "SENTENCE_3623": "It's nothing personal.",
    "SENTENCE_3624": "I see...",
    "SENTENCE_3625": "I'll make them all suffer!",
    "SENTENCE_3626": "Don't you look down on me.",
    "SENTENCE_3627": "I'll send you to your eternal rest.",
    "SENTENCE_3628": "I knew you were all talk...",
    "SENTENCE_3629": "Grrrnn...",
    "SENTENCE_3630": "You think I'll fall for that?",
    "SENTENCE_3631": "Next...",
    "SENTENCE_3632": "Let's do something about those annoying jerks.",
    "SENTENCE_3633": "You're pretty tough.",
    "SENTENCE_3634": "That ain't happening!",
    "SENTENCE_3635": "That was a close one.",
    "SENTENCE_3636": "...I don't want a body like that.",
    "SENTENCE_3637": "Look what they did to their body...",
    "SENTENCE_3638": "I've got a bad feeling about this.",
    "SENTENCE_3639": "Don't let your guard down.",
    "SENTENCE_3640": "The plan's a wash if you get taken out.",
    "SENTENCE_3641": "Shut up, I know.",
    "SENTENCE_3642": "There's no way I'd lose to a jerk like this.",
    "SENTENCE_3643": "Shut your trap.",
    "SENTENCE_3644": "Hooo ho ho ho!",
    "SENTENCE_3645": "Things are getting pretty heated.",
    "SENTENCE_3646": "I'll be the last one to take you on.",
    "SENTENCE_3647": "All of you, come at me.",
    "SENTENCE_3648": "You all...",
    "SENTENCE_3649": "Fantastic!",
    "SENTENCE_3650": "That's...",
    "SENTENCE_3651": "Can't stand the sight of you.",
    "SENTENCE_3652": "Hey, I can hear you.",
    "SENTENCE_3653": "The natural outcome.",
    "SENTENCE_3654": "Humph, that wasn't so hard.",
    "SENTENCE_3655": "It's 'cause you messed up...",
    "SENTENCE_3656": "You need to be more serious.",
    "SENTENCE_3657": "Oh ho ho ho! Very good!",
    "SENTENCE_3658": "That was a close one...",
    "SENTENCE_3659": "Sheesh, what a treacherous bunch.",
    "SENTENCE_3660": "I'm strong enough on my own.",
    "SENTENCE_3661": "Yeah! Thanks a lot!",
    "SENTENCE_3662": "Not looking for revenge, then?",
    "SENTENCE_3663": "That's impossible for me as I am now.",
    "SENTENCE_3664": "I'm pretty much helpless...",
    "SENTENCE_3665": "...Take a stance.",
    "SENTENCE_3666": "Huh?",
    "SENTENCE_3667": "Let me see this for myself.",
    "SENTENCE_3668": "H-hey, this is just too sudden!",
    "SENTENCE_3669": "Your real problem is that broken spirit of yours!",
    "SENTENCE_3670": "I'll smash you flat!",
    "SENTENCE_3671": "What's wrong?! That all you got?!",
    "SENTENCE_3672": "I'm still in this!",
    "SENTENCE_3673": "I won't hold back, now.",
    "SENTENCE_3674": "No...!",
    "SENTENCE_3675": "I can do more...",
    "SENTENCE_3676": "I've learned plenty of things!",
    "SENTENCE_3677": "That's a nice technique.",
    "SENTENCE_3678": "I practiced it a lot, after all!",
    "SENTENCE_3679": "Don't worry, you're plenty strong...",
    "SENTENCE_3680": "Understood!",
    "SENTENCE_3681": "Keep it together!",
    "SENTENCE_3696": "Don't worry, I'll be sure to hold back.",
    "SENTENCE_3698": "Get stronger as fast as you can...",
    "SENTENCE_3699": "And when you do, I'll beat you for sure.",
    "SENTENCE_3700": "How I've waited for this fight! Now let's have some fun!",
    "SENTENCE_3701": "Come on, focus on the fight.",
    "SENTENCE_3702": "You're a tough one...",
    "SENTENCE_3703": "???",
    "SENTENCE_3704": "Uh-oh...",
    "SENTENCE_3705": "Whoa, thank you!",
    "SENTENCE_3706": "About that...",
    "SENTENCE_3707": "Cut!",
    "SENTENCE_3708": "Time to try again...",
    "SENTENCE_3709": "However...",
    "SENTENCE_3710": "Hey! This is taking too much time!",
    "SENTENCE_3711": "Why...",
    "SENTENCE_3712": "What? Something bothering you?",
    "SENTENCE_3713": "Making a ruckus with such a dumb getup... What are you up to?",
    "SENTENCE_3714": "Oh boy... That only leaves us one choice...",
    "SENTENCE_3715": "Wow! Wonderful!",
    "SENTENCE_3716": "No...! This is...!",
    "SENTENCE_3717": "Quite the unexpected choice!",
    "SENTENCE_3718": "I couldn't refuse...",
    "SENTENCE_3719": "Oh, uh...",
    "SENTENCE_3720": "Good, good!",
    "SENTENCE_3721": "Let's do this right...",
    "SENTENCE_3722": "So cool!",
    "SENTENCE_3723": "You need to look cool when you beat them!",
    "SENTENCE_3724": "You've got this!",
    "SENTENCE_3725": "Hey, now!",
    "SENTENCE_3726": "Hmm, what should I do now...?",
    "SENTENCE_3727": "I'm sorry...",
    "SENTENCE_3728": "Hey! Don't say stuff that's not in the script!",
    "SENTENCE_3729": "Time for a cool pose!",
    "SENTENCE_3730": "Just have to beat these punks in the meantime.",
    "SENTENCE_3731": "Let's get through this!",
    "SENTENCE_3732": "Yeah, yeah, sure...",
    "SENTENCE_3733": "Hurry, already!",
    "SENTENCE_3734": "Mwahahaha!",
    "SENTENCE_3735": "Heh heh heh, is that right?",
    "SENTENCE_3736": "All right! Here we go!",
    "SENTENCE_3737": "Y-you got it!",
    "SENTENCE_3738": "Sheesh, talk about rude...",
    "SENTENCE_3739": "Punishment time!",
    "SENTENCE_3740": "I'll send you flying with some smooth moves!",
    "SENTENCE_3741": "Let us blossom and let us sing out!\r\nThe song of love and victory! Now, to transform!",
    "SENTENCE_3742": "There's no time for that!",
    "SENTENCE_3743": "A simple request...",
    "SENTENCE_3744": "Who's number one?!",
    "SENTENCE_3745": "I think I'm forgetting something important...",
    "SENTENCE_3746": "What the...? Wow, you're sloppy!",
    "SENTENCE_3747": "Why isn't anyone coming?",
    "SENTENCE_3748": "Oh, well.",
    "SENTENCE_3749": "Looks like I can't win yet!",
    "SENTENCE_3750": "Right, no pulling any punches!",
    "SENTENCE_3751": "Let us feel young again!",
    "SENTENCE_3752": "Ta-dah!",
    "SENTENCE_3753": "Heh heh! No more mercy!",
    "SENTENCE_3754": "Not yet! I'm not even close to losing!",
    "SENTENCE_3755": "Humph, if you say so...",
    "SENTENCE_3756": "Time to end this.",
    "SENTENCE_3757": "All right! I want the both of you to come at me!",
    "SENTENCE_3758": "Whoa! Wasn't expecting that!",
    "SENTENCE_3759": "Looks fun! Let me in the mix!",
    "SENTENCE_3760": "Don't waste my time. I may not look it, but I'm very busy.",
    "SENTENCE_3761": "Sure, time for the main event!",
    "SENTENCE_3762": "Inconceivable...",
    "SENTENCE_3763": "W-what...? WHAT?!",
    "SENTENCE_3764": "Not even a hello...? You're a weird one,\r\nthat's for sure!",
    "SENTENCE_3765": "I'll take your body for my own!",
    "SENTENCE_3766": "I can do this all day!",
    "SENTENCE_3767": "That is absurd...",
    "SENTENCE_3768": "Who knows what that thing can do... Don't get careless.",
    "SENTENCE_3769": "You should have just followed my lead...",
    "SENTENCE_3770": "I heard that, you know!",
    "SENTENCE_3771": "Humph. I only said what I was thinking.",
    "SENTENCE_3772": "Looks like we're evenly matched.",
    "SENTENCE_3773": "Finish 'em off.",
    "SENTENCE_3774": "There's more to an imposter like you than I thought!",
    "SENTENCE_3775": "Who knows what they'll try next...",
    "SENTENCE_3776": "You can transform too, of course.",
    "SENTENCE_3777": "Things are finally heating up!",
    "SENTENCE_3778": "Waiting for me to make the first move?\r\nYou must take me for a fool.",
    "SENTENCE_3779": "C'mon! Bring it on, already!",
    "SENTENCE_3780": "Cut it out already!",
    "SENTENCE_3781": "Show me your true power!",
    "SENTENCE_3782": "You think you're a match for me?",
    "SENTENCE_3783": "I mean, I'm still stronger, of course.",
    "SENTENCE_3784": "Who are you?",
    "SENTENCE_3785": "This is what you've been waiting for, right?",
    "SENTENCE_3786": "This is how strong I am now!",
    "SENTENCE_3787": "Now we're getting somewhere.",
    "SENTENCE_3788": "Bring it on!",
    "SENTENCE_3789": "This is me at full power!",
    "SENTENCE_3790": "Victory is mine!",
    "SENTENCE_3791": "Perhaps I've been too cautious.",
    "SENTENCE_3792": "What? You too...?",
    "SENTENCE_3793": "You want a fair fight, is that it?",
    "SENTENCE_3794": "You thought you could win? Gimme a break.",
    "SENTENCE_3795": "That's it...?",
    "SENTENCE_3796": "I thought I'd found it...",
    "SENTENCE_3802": "Heh heh heh, you can't stop us.",
    "SENTENCE_3819": "Magnificent...",
    "SENTENCE_3882": "Aha ha ha... Sounds about right.",
    "SENTENCE_3895": "I'm hungry!",
    "SENTENCE_3902": "I'm telling you...",
    "SENTENCE_3903": "Show me the results of your training!",
    "SENTENCE_3904": "(In that case...)",
    "SENTENCE_3905": "(I'll just have to prove how strong I've become!)",
    "SENTENCE_3906": "I rarely show anyone this transformation...",
    "SENTENCE_3907": "But for you, I'll make an exception!",
    "SENTENCE_3908": "My true form!",
    "SENTENCE_3909": "Try hard enough, and they may forgive you.",
    "SENTENCE_3910": "Do you understand now?\r\nThere's no way you can win!",
    "SENTENCE_3911": "Now, give me back my body!",
    "SENTENCE_3912": "Please, forgive me!",
    "SENTENCE_3913": "You're not worth my time!",
    "SENTENCE_3914": "!",
    "SENTENCE_3915": "Today is the day...!",
    "SENTENCE_3916": "Damn it!",
    "SENTENCE_3917": "Sorry, but we'll have to continue this another time!",
    "SENTENCE_3918": "How infuriating...",
    "SENTENCE_3924": "Good. It's settled, then.",
    "SENTENCE_3968": "The thunder of the wild! And the roar of love! Kakunsa!",
    "SENTENCE_3970": "Ngh... And I was so close!",
    "SENTENCE_3975": "Ungh...",
    "SENTENCE_3979": "The strike of love, with dreams and magic! Roasie!",
    "SENTENCE_3982": "Too bad for you!",
    "SENTENCE_3983": "Don't give up. Do come and challenge me again.",
    "SENTENCE_3984": "Another one bites the dust.",
    "SENTENCE_3985": "Looks like there are still a few fighters left!",
    "SENTENCE_3986": "And then there was one.",
    "SENTENCE_3987": "Just a short ways away from victory!",
    "SENTENCE_3988": "Oh my, to fall short now...",
    "SENTENCE_3989": "Aw, man!",
    "SENTENCE_3990": "Oh-ho! So, you were merely waiting for your chance!",
    "SENTENCE_3992": "Congratulations, champion.",
    "SENTENCE_3993": "Can't afford to lose.",
    "SENTENCE_3996": "A wicked being, born from a wicked plan...",
    "SENTENCE_3997": "At this rate...",
    "SENTENCE_3998": "Stubborn, aren't you!",
    "SENTENCE_3999": "Wh-who the heck is that guy?!",
    "SENTENCE_4000": "Please, don't lose!",
    "SENTENCE_4001": "Thank you for saving me!",
    "SENTENCE_4002": "Ah, there's still more...",
    "SENTENCE_4003": "Hope wasn't lost just yet.",
    "SENTENCE_4004": "The few who survived...",
    "SENTENCE_4005": "You must win...!",
    "SENTENCE_4006": "Be careful!",
    "SENTENCE_4007": "I've got a bad feeling about this...!",
    "SENTENCE_4008": "That hope lives on through others...",
    "SENTENCE_4009": "Just how many years have passed...?",
    "SENTENCE_4010": "Both of them have been battered blue!",
    "SENTENCE_4011": "Go for it!",
    "SENTENCE_4012": "Make this a match to remember!",
    "SENTENCE_4013": "How will it end...?!",
    "SENTENCE_4014": "This is shaping up to be a historic contest of wills.",
    "SENTENCE_4015": "The fierce battle is nearing its climax!",
    "SENTENCE_4016": "Looks like they're both summoning their last bit of strength!",
    "SENTENCE_4017": "Come on, everyone! Don't be stingy with your applause!",
    "SENTENCE_4018": "Oh, man!",
    "SENTENCE_4019": "What?!",
    "SENTENCE_4020": "At this rate, it'll be the same tragedy all over again!",
    "SENTENCE_4021": "Right now, you're the only one who can stop them!",
    "SENTENCE_4022": "Please, do what you can to buy some time!",
    "SENTENCE_4023": "We'll send them into the next universe...!",
    "SENTENCE_4024": "It's a desperate plan!",
    "SENTENCE_4025": "A little longer...just hang on!",
    "SENTENCE_4026": "I'm sure they'll be back any minute now!",
    "SENTENCE_4027": "Half down, half to go...!",
    "SENTENCE_4028": "You can do it! Just a little more...!",
    "SENTENCE_4029": "Please, hurry...!",
    "SENTENCE_4030": "(Please send them far, far away!)",
    "SENTENCE_4031": "Azure Impulse",
    "SENTENCE_4032": "Legendary Assault",
    "SENTENCE_4033": "Abhorrent Army",
    "SENTENCE_4034": "Not too shabby! But I'm not done, either!",
    "SENTENCE_4035": "Switch with me! I'll handle that one!",
    "SENTENCE_4036": "Heh... Sorry I kept you waiting.",
    "SENTENCE_4037": "Yeah! Bring it!",
    "SENTENCE_4038": "Surprising... I didn't think you'd make it this far.",
    "SENTENCE_4039": "It only gets harder from here on out!",
    "SENTENCE_4040": "Gaaaaaah!",
    "SENTENCE_4041": "Urgh!",
    "SENTENCE_4042": "Uraaaaah!!!",
    "SENTENCE_4043": "Heh heh heh, I'll crush you!",
    "SENTENCE_4044": "Well, well... This suddenly promises to be a very interesting fight...",
    "SENTENCE_4045": "You should feel honored! You will be the first to\r\nwitness my ultimate transformation...",
    "SENTENCE_4046": "The first and the last, that is!",
    "SENTENCE_4047": "True hell has only just begun.",
    "SENTENCE_4048": "I see... I wasn't expecting this.",
    "SENTENCE_4049": "I'm finally feeling warmed up, too!",
    "SENTENCE_4050": "You're going to fight me like that?!",
    "SENTENCE_4051": "You're going, even if I have to force you!",
    "SENTENCE_4052": "Know that I won't go easy on you!",
    "SENTENCE_4053": "Their power level is rising...?!",
    "SENTENCE_4054": "If you lose, there'll be no one left to protect this place!",
    "SENTENCE_4055": "This place is going to be ruined!"
